      "\n",
      "Question: What are the implications of the weakening multilateral trading system on global trade?\n",
      "Answer: The weakening multilateral trading system is likely to lead to a more fragmented and protectionist global trade landscape. This could result in increased tariffs and non-tariff barriers, making it more difficult for countries like Singapore to access international markets. As a small and open economy, Singapore may face significant challenges in maintaining its competitive edge and attracting foreign investments. The shift towards zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation could also lead to a decrease in global trade volumes and an increase in tensions between nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How are countries prioritizing their defense and security interests in the current global climate?\n",
      "Answer: Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests by shifting from win-win cooperation to zero-sum competition. This means that nations are preparing for potential conflict and recognizing the need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Which groups did Ms Jean See, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlight as needing more support?\n",
      "Answer: The Tripartite Workgroup aims to address the needs of various groups, including freelance and agency workers, as well as working mothers. These groups require additional support to improve Singapore's adult education and training system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What actions have been taken to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce?\n",
      "Answer: We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What measures is Singapore taking to enhance its competitiveness in the global market?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What are the reasons behind major powers preparing for conflict despite stating they do not want it?\n",

This is because they recognize that economic heft and technological prowess are crucial in winning global supremacy, and a strong industrial base is essential to sustain any war effort. Additionally, the fear of being at a disadvantage compared to other nations drives this motivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How is Singapore addressing the concerns about technology leakage while remaining an open hub?\n",

      "Question: Why might small and open economies like Singapore be disadvantaged in the current global system?\n",
      "Answer: The current global system is characterized by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures, which have weakened the multilateral trading system. This shift towards zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation can disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore due to their reliance on international trade and commerce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why is it important for Singapore to stay open as a hub in today's fragmented world?\n",
      "Answer: In today's world, staying connected with the rest of the globe is crucial for economic growth and prosperity.

It benefits workers by providing them with higher wages that are matched to productivity gains, allowing them to improve their standard of living and enjoy better working conditions. This model helps to address the issue of stagnant wages in recent years, where wage increases have lagged behind productivity growth. By implementing this model, workers can benefit from increased earnings and improved job prospects, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and progressive society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why is there a need to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe?\n",

      "Answer: The goal of the talent development strategy is to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector. This includes providing support to equip Singaporeans with the skills and experience needed to succeed on their own merit, particularly for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities. The ultimate aim is to grow a leadership pipeline that can compete with regional and global standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How is the Singaporean government planning to support senior worker employment according to the budget?\n",
      "Answer: The Singaporean government plans to support senior worker employment by extending the Senior Employment Credit (SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $4,000 a month. Additionally, the Government will reimburse companies up to 7% of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the role of the Tripartite Workgroup in addressing senior worker employment issues?\n",
      "Answer: The Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment plays a crucial role in undertaking a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies to improve the employability of seniors and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why is there a need to invest more in adult education and training compared to pre-employment training?\n",
      "Answer: Investing more in adult education and training is necessary because many countries have invested more in pre-employment training. This means that Singapore's approach may not be directly comparable, but rather it needs to find its own way forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: In what ways is Singapore at the forefront of adult education and training compared to other countries?\n",
      "Answer: Singapore's adult education and training system has made significant strides in recent years. While there are still areas for improvement, the country has taken a proactive approach to addressing the needs of its workforce. One key aspect of this is the emphasis on providing opportunities for mid-career workers to upskill and reskill through the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme. This initiative aims to support workers who may not have had access to formal education or training earlier in their careers, but are now looking to enhance their skills to remain competitive in the job market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another area where Singapore is making a notable impact is in its investment in vocational training and apprenticeships. The government has recognized the importance of providing practical, hands-on experience for workers, and has taken steps to increase funding and support for these types of programs. This approach acknowledges that many workers may not have the time or resources to pursue traditional academic pathways, but still want to acquire new skills and knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Singapore's commitment to adult education and training is focused on providing flexible, accessible, and effective solutions that meet the diverse needs of its workforce. By investing in these areas, the government aims to create a more skilled and adaptable workforce, better equipped to thrive in an ever-changing economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What challenges does Singapore face in building up the SkillsFuture system?\n",
      "Answer: Singapore faces a challenge in that many countries have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training. This means that there is a gap between what has been done in formal schooling years and what needs to be done for adult education and training, which is a key component of the SkillsFuture system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What commitment has been made towards strengthening the SkillsFuture initiative in the coming years?\n",
      "Answer: The Government is fully committed to strengthening SkillsFuture and plans to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How does the government plan to create more opportunities and better jobs for Singaporeans?\n",
      "Answer: The government plans to create more opportunities and better jobs for Singaporeans by taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture. This includes putting in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture, as well as experimenting, innovating, and finding their own way forward since there are no ready models to look to internationally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are the global factors that have driven inflation in Singapore?\n",
      "Answer: Wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the GST increase affect inflation in Singapore according to the context?\n",
      "Answer: The GST increase did not have a direct impact on inflation in Singapore as forecasted by economists. In fact, the actual inflation rate was higher than expected, indicating that the GST increase may not have had the moderating effect anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's worth noting that the forecasters were predicting a decrease in inflation due to the increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate, which would lead to increased costs for businesses and potentially moderate inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How do high price levels create real pressures for people?\n",
      "Answer: Price levels that remain high despite eased inflation can create real pressures because they lead to sustained cost increases. This can be particularly challenging for individuals and businesses as it takes time for them to adjust to these new price realities, leading to ongoing financial strain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why are people still concerned about cost pressures despite the easing of inflation?\n",
      "Answer: Price levels remain high even though inflation has eased, creating real pressures that take time for people to adjust to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are the temporary help measures provided by the government to address cost-of-living concerns?\n",
      "Answer: The government is providing CDC Vouchers as a key plank of the SG60 surplus sharing package to provide some relief on the cost front. These vouchers are part of the temporary help measures being continued and expanded upon in this Budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What measures has the Singapore government taken to help citizens cope with inflation?\n",
      "Answer: The Singapore government has taken several measures to help citizens cope with inflation. These include providing additional support through the Assurance Package, which includes a $\\$1.9$ billion enhancement last year and additional U-Save rebates this financial year. Eligible households will receive up to $\\$760$ in U-Save rebates, covering about six months of utilities expenses for those living in 1and 2-room flats, and three months of utilities expenses for those living in 3- and 4-room flats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is 'vibecession' and how does it relate to the current economic sentiment in the US?\n",
      "Answer: The term \"vibecession\" refers to a phenomenon where positive headline economic indicators coexist with poor sentiments among the general public. This suggests that despite outward appearances of economic stability or growth, underlying concerns about cost pressures and inflation remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the trend in CPI inflation in Singapore from 2022 to 2024?\n",
      "Answer: CPI inflation moderated to 6.1% in 2022, then came down further to 4.8% in 2023, and finally decreased to 2.4% in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why are the Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party unhappy with the government's use of vouchers?\n",
      "Answer: They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why do price levels remain high even though inflation has eased?\n",
      "Answer: Price levels remain high due to the time it takes for people to adjust to new price realities. This adjustment period creates real pressures that cannot be ignored immediately after a decrease in inflation rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the current state of inflation globally and in Singapore?\n",
      "Answer: Global inflation has eased, but price levels remain high. Inflation in Singapore also moderated to 2.4% in 2024, indicating a decrease from previous years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What percentage of the budget is allocated to cost-of-living measures and the SG60 Package?\n",
      "Answer: 5%\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are the structural programmes mentioned that aim to equip and empower Singaporeans?\n",
      "Answer: Education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How does the government plan to ensure Singaporeans can seize better opportunities in a rapidly changing world?\n",

      "Answer: Singapore's real household income growth outperformed many other advanced economies over the past decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What data sources were used to estimate the annualised real household income growth among advanced economies?\n",
      "Answer: Data from National Statistical Offices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How are income growth rates for Finland and Japan computed differently from other economies?\n",
      "Answer: Income growth rates for Finland and Japan are computed using the average household incomes of the 2nd, 5th, and 8th deciles. In contrast, income growth rates for other economies are computed based on household incomes at the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What adjustments are made to account for household size differences in income growth data?\n",
      "Answer: For Finland and Japan, household income growth rates are computed using the average household incomes of the 2nd, 5th, and 8th deciles. In contrast, for other economies, including Singapore, the rates are calculated based on household incomes at the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentiles.\n",
      "\n",

      "Answer: Singapore's social support system provides more support for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why does the context suggest that the effect of the GST increase on inflation was 'transitory'?\n",
      "Answer: The context suggests that the effect of the GST increase on inflation was 'transitory' because subsequent CPI inflation rates moderated to 4.8% in 2023 and came down further to 2.4% in 2024, indicating that the initial impact of the GST increase on inflation was short-lived.\n",
