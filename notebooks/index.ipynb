It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.\\n3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:\\na. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.\\nb. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.', images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)),\n",

The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.\\nc. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.\\n5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.\\na. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.\\nb. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.\\nc.

New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.\\n7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.\\n8. We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.\\na. Our economy grew by $4.4 \\\\%$.\\nb. Inflation continued to ease.\\nc. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \\\\%$ above inflation.\\nd. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.\\n9.

Neither side wants to come to blows. But both know that economic heft and technological prowess are key to winning this global race.\\nc. And both are prepared to take more assertive actions to advance their own interests, even at the expense of established international norms.\\nd. So we can expect escalating attempts at containment and counter-containment, with ripple effects that will inevitably draw in other countries, including Singapore.\\n11. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.\\n12. For 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook.

We have forged a common Singaporean identity, grounded in our shared values and experiences, and our commitment to one another and our nation.\\n14. This is the legacy of generations of Singaporeans, with each one running a good race. The baton has now been passed, and it is our turn to take Singapore forward.

Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.\\n21. That's why we have been providing additional support measures over the last two years to cushion the impact on Singaporeans.\\na. Last year, I enhanced the Assurance Package by $\\\\$ 1.9$ billion.\\nb. The Package has helped to fully offset the effects of inflation for lower-income households, and to provide a significant cushion for middle-income households.\", images=[], dimensions=OCRPageDimensions(dpi=200, height=2339, width=1654)),\n",

Singaporeans are still adjusting to these new price realities. Some have had to tighten their belts, rethink spending habits, or make difficult trade-offs to manage their expenses.\\n23. Therefore, in this Budget, I will provide additional support for Singaporeans.\\na. First, I will provide $\\\\$ 800$ in CDC Vouchers to every Singaporean household.\\ni. The first $\\\\$ 500$ will be disbursed in May this year. And the remaining $\\\\$ 300$ will be disbursed in January next year.\\nii. As with previous CDC Vouchers, half can be used at participating supermarkets.

Eligible HDB households will receive up to $\\\\$ 760$ this financial year. This is double the amount of regular U-Save rebates. It will cover about six months of utilities expenses for those living in 1and 2-room flats, and three months of utilities expenses for those living in 3- and 4-room flats. \\n\\n## c. Third, I will provide more support to families with children. They will receive $\\\\$ 500$ in LifeSG credits for each Singaporean child aged 12 and below this year. These credits are the same as the LifeSG credits we gave to national servicemen last year. And parents can use them to defray their household expenses.\\n\\n## d. Every Singaporean aged 13 to 20 this year will also receive a $\\\\$ 500$ top-up to their Edusave account, or their Post-\\n\\nSecondary Education Account.

Those supported by Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance will also receive more than before, based on the household's composition, needs, and income.\\nb. In tandem, we will increase the Singapore Allowance, which is an ex-gratia payment that some of our pensioners receive. It will increase from $\\\\$ 350$ to $\\\\$ 390$ each month, to support those with smaller pensions. And the monthly pension ceiling will also increase to $\\\\$ 1,320$.\\nc.

Over the next three years, MND will launch more than 50,000 new flats in a wide range of locations, including in Woodlands, Bayshore, and Mount Pleasant.\\nc. Last year, more than eight in 10 first-timer families who collected keys to their BTO flats were able to service their monthly mortgage loans with little or zero out-of-pocket cash. To put in perspective, this is a level of affordability that residents in other major cities like London, Sydney, and Hong Kong do not enjoy. But we have been able to achieve this in Singapore.

In 2023, the Ministry of Finance released an Occasional Paper showing that we expect to keep our fiscal position roughly balanced until 2030. For now, this remains our assessment. And let me explain.\\n177. There is still considerable uncertainty about how Government revenues will unfold over the coming decades.\\na. At this juncture, it is too early to determine if the recent increase in Corporate Income Tax collections is temporary or a lasting trend.\\nb. There could be some additional Corporate Income Tax revenue from FY2027 onwards, with the implementation of the Domestic Top-up Tax, which will raise the large MNEs' effective tax rate to $15 \\\\%$.

So we will assess our options as global tax developments unfold, and adjust our policies where necessary.\\n178. Meanwhile, we are certain that expenditure will continue to rise. Government spending has been rising steadily over the years from about $15 \\\\%$ of GDP to about $18 \\\\%$.\\na. And based on historical trends, we can expect our spending to go up to 20\\\\% of GDP by around 2030.\\nb.

There are dark clouds over the horizon. The world is in turmoil, and the situation is likely to get worse in the coming years.\\n182.

Like Mr Yau Jon Kiang, who is 75 this year and a resident in Yew Tee. In our early years of nation-building, he and his wife worked long hours in a canteen at the Tanjong Gul Camp at Tuas.

      "2. 2025 marks our $60^{\\text {th }}$ year of independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.\n",
      "3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:\n",
      "a. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n",
      "b. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. As a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges.\n",
      "a. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant.\n",
      "b. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.\n",
      "c. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.\n",
      "5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.\n",
      "a. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.\n",
      "b. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.\n",
      "c. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Today, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.\n",
      "7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.\n",
      "8. We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.\n",
      "a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \\%$.\n",
      "b. Inflation continued to ease.\n",
      "c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \\%$ above inflation.\n",
      "d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.\n",
      "9. All this has given us good momentum for our next phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. But we expect greater global uncertainty and downside risks.\n",
      "a. The US and China are locked in a fierce contest for global supremacy.\n",
      "b. Neither side wants to come to blows. But both know that economic heft and technological prowess are key to winning this global race.\n",
      "c. And both are prepared to take more assertive actions to advance their own interests, even at the expense of established international norms.\n",
      "d. So we can expect escalating attempts at containment and counter-containment, with ripple effects that will inevitably draw in other countries, including Singapore.\n",
      "11. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.\n",
      "12. For 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook. Growth is projected at $1 \\%$ to $3 \\%$, while inflation is expected to average $1.5 \\%$ to $2.5 \\%$.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. But despite the uncertainties, we can look ahead with a degree of confidence. Singapore today is far stronger than we were 60 years ago.\n",
      "a. We have developed a strong and well-diversified economy, supported by a highly skilled workforce.\n",
      "b. We have built up a robust SAF and a strong diplomatic network, to uphold our sovereignty and security.\n",
      "c. We have forged a common Singaporean identity, grounded in our shared values and experiences, and our commitment to one another and our nation.\n",
      "14. This is the legacy of generations of Singaporeans, with each one running a good race. The baton has now been passed, and it is our turn to take Singapore forward. This Budget builds on previous Budgets, not only to address today's challenges, but to plan ahead and secure Singapore's future.\n",
      "15. Budget 2025 is a Budget for all Singaporeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. It's also a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans. It further advances our Forward Singapore agenda, which incorporates your aspirations and views, and seeks to keep our society strong and united.\n",
      "17. In this Budget, we will work with you to:\n",
      "a. Tackle cost pressures;\n",
      "b. Advance our growth frontier;\n",
      "c. Equip workers throughout life;\n",
      "d. Build a sustainable city;\n",
      "e. Nurture a caring and inclusive society; and\n",

At last year's Budget, I introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, to support mid-career Singaporeans in getting a significant skills reboot.\\na. Under the programme, all Singaporeans aged 40 years and above will get $\\\\$ 4,000$ in SkillsFuture Credit.\\nb. From next month, individuals can apply for a training allowance of up to $\\\\$ 3,000$ per month for selected full-time courses. They will have 24 months' worth of allowance, which is up to $\\\\$ 72,000$ per worker.\\n71. Some Singaporeans prefer to continue working, while upskilling on a part-time basis.\\na. Take for example, Ms Zarina Binti Abdul Rahman. She started out as an intern in Randstad Sourceright, a global recruitment agency, and is now an office administrator.\\n\\nb. She wants to upgrade her skills in business operations, but is unable to pursue full-time studies due to her work and family commitments. So she is pursuing a part-time Diploma in Business Practice at Nanyang Polytechnic.\\n72. While workers like Zarina continue to earn their salaries during part-time training, they also incur training-related expenses.\\na. We will therefore extend the training allowance to workers undergoing part-time training.\\nb. They can enjoy a fixed allowance of $\\\\$ 300$ per month to defray their learning expenses.\\nc. And this part-time training allowance will be implemented early next year.\\nd. The Minister for Education will share more at the Committee of Supply.\\n\\n73. We will also give a further boost to our lower-wage workers, who will benefit from early upskilling.\\na. Today, our lower-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Skills Support Scheme from the age of 30.\\nb. The scheme provides employers with absentee payroll support when they sponsor workers for training. It also provides workers with a training allowance when they go for self-sponsored training.\\n74. Currently, the Workfare Skills Support Scheme is designed primarily to support short courses that are completed over a few days. But lower-wage workers stand to benefit more from longerform courses that provide more substantial reskilling and upskilling.\\n75. We will therefore introduce an enhanced tier of support under the Workfare Skills Support for lower-wage workers. This enhanced support will be modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, and will benefit lower-wage workers when they turn 30. So this will start earlier at age 30. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the Committee of Supply (COS).\\n\\n76. Our Institutes of Higher Learning are key partners in supporting lifelong learning.

At last year's Budget, I introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, to support mid-career Singaporeans in getting a significant skills reboot.\\na. Under the programme, all Singaporeans aged 40 years and above will get $\\\\$ 4,000$ in SkillsFuture Credit.\\nb. From next month, individuals can apply for a training allowance of up to $\\\\$ 3,000$ per month for selected full-time courses. They will have 24 months' worth of allowance, which is up to $\\\\$ 72,000$ per worker.\\n71. Some Singaporeans prefer to continue working, while upskilling on a part-time basis.\\na. Take for example, Ms Zarina Binti Abdul Rahman. She started out as an intern in Randstad Sourceright, a global recruitment agency, and is now an office administrator.\\n\\nb. She wants to upgrade her skills in business operations, but is unable to pursue full-time studies due to her work and family commitments. So she is pursuing a part-time Diploma in Business Practice at Nanyang Polytechnic.\\n72. While workers like Zarina continue to earn their salaries during part-time training, they also incur training-related expenses.\\na. We will therefore extend the training allowance to workers undergoing part-time training.\\nb. They can enjoy a fixed allowance of $\\\\$ 300$ per month to defray their learning expenses.\\nc. And this part-time training allowance will be implemented early next year.\\nd. The Minister for Education will share more at the Committee of Supply.\\n\\n73. We will also give a further boost to our lower-wage workers, who will benefit from early upskilling.\\na. Today, our lower-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Skills Support Scheme from the age of 30.\\nb. The scheme provides employers with absentee payroll support when they sponsor workers for training. It also provides workers with a training allowance when they go for self-sponsored training.\\n74. Currently, the Workfare Skills Support Scheme is designed primarily to support short courses that are completed over a few days. But lower-wage workers stand to benefit more from longerform courses that provide more substantial reskilling and upskilling.\\n75. We will therefore introduce an enhanced tier of support under the Workfare Skills Support for lower-wage workers. This enhanced support will be modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, and will benefit lower-wage workers when they turn 30. So this will start earlier at age 30. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the Committee of Supply (COS).\\n\\n76. Our Institutes of Higher Learning are key partners in supporting lifelong learning. They equip our workers with relevant skills for a changing economy, and provide a dedicated setting for deep learning.\\na. We will support the Singapore University of Social Sciences (or SUSS) in developing a new city campus. This will enable SUSS to champion lifelong learning and deliver programmes with a strong social emphasis, at an accessible location in the city for learners of all ages.\\nb.

It does not introduce new information that isn\\'t already present within the original text.\\n   \\nGiven these observations, the generated answer effectively demonstrates grounding by mirroring both the content and structure of the provided context.\\n\\n**Evaluation Conclusion**: The groundness of the answer can be considered excellent, given its direct correspondence with the context\\'s key piece of information.
