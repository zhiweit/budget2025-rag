What are the means testing criteria that need fine-tuning?,"Means testing criteria related to incomes, such as per capita household income, family income (with data limitations), lifelong earnings income, and wealth measures.","Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.
iii. 

And so these are issues we will continue to fine tune in terms of means testing criteria.
b. Ms Jean See, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlighted other groups that may need more support such as freelance and agency

workers, as well as working mothers.
c. Ms Usha Chandradas earlier championed for the arts, and Mr Ong Hua Han reminded us to ensure our arts and sports scene remains inclusive.
d. And Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Rachel Ong advocated for mental health issues.
e. These are some of the key points members have raised.


D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

But more importantly, let's look at the overall picture. We continue to have a highly progressive tax and transfer system.
a. Members are familiar with the benefits and tax ratios, which we highlight every budget. And it's worth going through them again.
b. The bottom quintile of households receives $\$ 4$ in benefits for every dollar of tax paid. Middle-income households also get more benefits than tax paid as you go through the income thresholds and levels.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
c. In fact, it's only the top quintile of income earners receives less in benefits, or 30 cents, for every dollar of tax paid. So this is what our system has achieved.
d. So these outcomes are a culmination of years of deliberate moves to enhance the progressivity of our overall taxes and transfers system.
75. There is no fiscal system in the world that can deliver perfect precision and equity. But I think we have found an approach in Singapore that works for us. It is not perfect, but we continue to make it better.

a. Here, everyone contributes to taxes. The lower and middle-income will receive more support, while the higher-income and wealthier segments of the population will contribute more. It's a fair and progressive tax and redistribution system, anchored on our values of a fair and just society.
b. And the strength of our fiscal system is internationally recognised. A recent OECD report commended Singapore on our robust fiscal system.
c. This is hard-earned credibility that we have built up over many, many decades. It is not something we should take for granted, because that same credibility can be quickly destroyed in the wrong hands.
76. And at the end of the day, something as fundamental as this, Singaporeans will decide.
77. Will they prefer a government that underestimates our needs, spends more from our hard-earned reserves, and leaves us weaker?
78. Or will they prefer a government that is steadfast, that upholds fiscal responsibility and discipline, and ensures we have enough resources for current and future generations to handle unexpected challenges?
a. Sir, the PAP's approach is clear: we take our duty as stewards of the country seriously. We remain true to our mission, and manage our finances carefully for the benefit of all Singaporeans, now and in the future.
b. We will continue to do our best to convince Singaporeans that ours is the right approach - it has served us well these last 60 years, and it will continue to keep Singapore on the right track in the years ahead.

Members have offered many suggestions. Ms Hazel Poa said we need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations, and that we are overly reliant on the price mechanism, citing land as an example.
35. But pricing all resources properly is not about giving more weight to economic over social considerations; it's simply about getting our policies right and doing things the right way.
a. If we don't price properly, then we are giving a hidden subsidy.
b. A subsidy means someone has to pay. If it's not paid by consumers, it's paid by taxpayers. If it's not paid today, it will have to be paid tomorrow.
c. Because at the end of the day, there is no free lunch.
36. So our approach must be to get the price right. Then we decide how much to subsidise.
a. Take public housing as an example.
b. HDB has to pay the market price for the land when it develops a new flat.
c. But when it prices the new flat for sale, it doesn't recover fully the cost of the flat; instead, it prices it on the basis of affordability as we have said time and again.

d. I give you a concrete example. A 4-room BTO flat in Sengkang. This was in the October 2024 BTO exercise.
e. After accounting for grants, a resale flat nearby in that area is around $\$ 545,000$. Five years ago, it was about \$360,000Resale prices have gone up nearly $\$ 200,000$.
f. What about the sales price by HDB for a new flat? The BTO price has not gone up by that much. Instead, it has increased in line with median income over that period, and was sold at about $\$ 370,000$.
g. So resale prices have gone up a lot. BTO, yes, but not as much, and in line with median incomes.
h. The difference is a subsidy borne by the government.
i. That, together with the higher cost of construction, that is one of the key reasons why HDB's deficit has increased sharply. If you look at its annual statements, in FY2018 the deficit was $\$ 2$ billion. Now in FY2023 it's $\$ 6.8$ billion. And the Government's funding to HDB to cover its deficit has correspondingly increased over the years, to cover the deficit.
37. 

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

144. 

# D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans? 

53. Finally: on a third issue, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans, especially in light of our surplus position?
54. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the treatment of SINGA and how it contributed to the surplus.
a. Under SINGA, we borrow for major and long-term infrastructure projects. The spending for such projects is capitalised, which allows us to spread the expenses across the useful life of the asset.
b. This, as we have explained, is more equitable as the asset will benefit both current and future generations.

c. This accounting treatment has been in place since FY2021.


To achieve this, we must continue to uphold several fundamentals. That includes:
a. Maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies;
b. Harnessing market forces to drive efficiency and innovation;
c. Staying open to people and ideas to strengthen our capabilities;
d. And deepening our tripartite partnership as a cornerstone of economic stability.
36. At the same time, our approach and strategy must adapt to changing circumstances.
a. At this stage of development, we can no longer compete on cost alone. Instead, we must differentiate ourselves by producing high-value solutions for the world.
b. To take our economy forward, this Budget will emphasise three key areas: technology and innovation, our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our infrastructure investments amidst resource constraints.

Take retirement as one example. Our CPF system will be 70 years old this year. In a time where many pension systems are struggling with sustainability, we continue to provide assurance for Singaporeans' retirement adequacy in a sustainable manner.
a. At its core, the CPF enables Singaporeans to save for their own retirement, with support from their employers.
b. But we don't just leave this to individuals alone.
c. Families are encouraged to help their loved ones save more. And we provide avenues for them to do so, with matching grants from the Government.

d. The Government provides risk-free interest rates, with extra interest for lower balances to boost savings.
e. We support lower-wage workers to earn more (and save more) through Workfare and Progressive Wages.
f. And for seniors who had lower incomes during their working years and so less in retirement, we have Silver Support to cover them.
g. So these improvements have been made to CPF over the years. And more recently, when we studied the data, we saw the need to do more for two groups:
i. First, ITE graduates whose wage trajectories were not rising fast enough compared to their peers in Polytechnics and Universities; and second, young seniors in their 50s and early 60s who could use more support for their retirement.
ii. And that's why we introduced the ITE Progression Award last year, which will support ITE graduates to pursue a diploma, and provide a top-up to their CPF accounts when they complete their diploma studies.
iii. And we also introduced the substantial Majulah Package for young seniors, and that included the one-time Retirement Savings Bonus and the MediSave Bonus, as well as a substantial Earn and Save Bonus.
45. Several members, in particular Mr Louis Chua and Mr Saktiandi Supaat, spoke at length about retirement adequacy.
a. I listened to them carefully, and we will consider all your views and suggestions.
b. On the recommendations of the CPF Advisory Panel, many have, in fact, already been taken up. There are now various low-cost funds included

under the CPF Investment Scheme which members can choose to invest in.
c. The question is whether there is scope for a low-cost life cycle fund, done in a more comprehensive and structured way, beyond just leaving CPF members to choose for themselves. Because these options exist, they can choose, but whether there is scope to do it in a more structured way.
d. Now, if we were to do that, the fund must be able to earn better returns than the prevailing SA rate, the Special Account rate, not the OA rate. And that is $4 \%$ on a risk-free basis, and up to $6 \%$ based on the extra interest. Actually, that's not so easy to beat on a consistent basis
e. Sure, you can opt to take more risks for higher returns. Mr Chua mentioned an 80:20 portfolio promising above 7\% returns. But I think he qualified, potential returns. If you are lucky you may get $7 \%$ or more. What happens if you are not so lucky? What happens if you retire at a time of market downturn? How do we provide assurance to Singaporeans?
f. So these are issues we will have to consider carefully. But we will certainly continue to review, fine-tune and improve the CPF system - to meet the needs of our seniors, and to prepare for a future with increased longevity and life expectancy."
What mental health issues were advocated for by Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Rachel Ong?,Mental health issues.,"And so these are issues we will continue to fine tune in terms of means testing criteria.
b. Ms Jean See, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlighted other groups that may need more support such as freelance and agency

workers, as well as working mothers.
c. Ms Usha Chandradas earlier championed for the arts, and Mr Ong Hua Han reminded us to ensure our arts and sports scene remains inclusive.
d. And Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Rachel Ong advocated for mental health issues.
e. These are some of the key points members have raised.


# Ensuring No One Is Left Behind 

46. This same approach applies to other areas, which many members spoke about.
a. For example, many MPs, Mr Vikram Nair, Associate Professor Razwana Begum, Ms Hany Soh, Mr Alex Yam, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Mr Louis

Ng, and Ms Carrie Tan, amongst others, spoke about more support for families, and support not just in financial terms, but also leave arrangements, which was a popular refrain from the speeches. We will have to look at all these suggestions.
b. Others like Ms Denise Phua, Mr Don Wee, Mr Ang Wei Neng, and Mr Sharael Taha have highlighted the need for more inclusive hiring practices and employment support for Persons with Disabilities. I agree we must do more for Persons with Disabilities. And in my Budget statement, I said we are embarking on a comprehensive study to look at post-18 pathways for people with disabilities, and we will want to do more for them.
c. Many members like SPS Eric Chua, Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Xie Yao Quan, and Mr Dennis Tan also spoke about the need to help our seniors age well and ensure they are not left behind in their silver years.
d. In fact we have made significant moves over the past 1-2 years to support these groups, including at this Budget.
e. But our attitude is we are never satisfied with the status quo, and will continue to review and study how we can make things better.
47. Likewise on the subject of caregivers, which many members spoke about, including Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Sharael Taha, Ms Ng Ling Ling, Ms Joan Pereira, and Dr Tan Wu Meng.
a. Caregiving arrangements vary from family to family - some have sole caregivers, while others will share the responsibility over several family members.
b. We recognise the crucial role caregivers play and the sacrifices they make, such as leaving employment to care for family arrangements, or forgoing their careers to spend more time to take care of their family

members. We want to provide support for those who have to take up this role, as it is not easy for them.
c. It is difficult to put a monetary value on caregiving. And furthermore, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to support caregivers. So our approach has been to provide support for the family as a whole.
d. And in this Budget, we have significantly enhanced the Home Caregiving Grant, and increased subsidies for care services in nursing homes and in the community.
e. But this not the end of our moves. In fact, we will study more to see how we can further strengthen our support for caregivers.
48. 

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.
iii. 

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.


I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

Consider the experiences of our pioneers. Like Mr Yau Jon Kiang, who is 75 this year and a resident in Yew Tee. In our early years of nation-building, he and his wife worked long hours in a canteen at the Tanjong Gul Camp at Tuas. They put food on the table for the SAF, as well as their own young sons at home. Times were tough, but they persevered.
184. Their never-say-die spirit lives on in the family.

185. Jon Kiang's son, Joses, forged his own path to become a naval engineer with the SAF. He endured long stints at sea to serve and defend our nation. 

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


55. Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about the assets linked to the $\$ 3$ billion money laundering case, which have been surrendered to the state. These assets are progressively being liquidated and when they are liquidated, the monies will be added to the Consolidated Fund. These funds are not earmarked for specific purposes, and will be part of our overall revenues to fund the Government's budget.
56. Several members including Mr Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, Ms Hazel Poa, and Mr Leong Mun Wai questioned the need to increase the GST, given our strong fiscal position.
57. I should remind Members that we are in this strong fiscal position precisely because the Government took the necessary steps early in this term to raise revenues.
58. "
What are some examples of participatory platforms mentioned in the context?,"Citizen panels, youth panels, and alliances for action are some examples of participatory platforms mentioned in the context.","There have also been calls for us to make bolder moves on social policies.
a. And you can look around the world: there are many examples of social support arrangements that started with the best of intentions, but only ended up with more problems.
b. For example, some promise sizeable pension payments funded by

younger generations, but now have problems paying for them.
c. Others offer free universal healthcare, but now face rising cost and an overburdened healthcare system.
42. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

# Building a Strong and Sustainable Social Support System 

33. These are desired outcomes which I'm sure we can all agree to. The question is how do we achieve them.
34. 

And so these are issues we will continue to fine tune in terms of means testing criteria.
b. Ms Jean See, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlighted other groups that may need more support such as freelance and agency

workers, as well as working mothers.
c. Ms Usha Chandradas earlier championed for the arts, and Mr Ong Hua Han reminded us to ensure our arts and sports scene remains inclusive.
d. And Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Rachel Ong advocated for mental health issues.
e. These are some of the key points members have raised.


49. We keep an open mind and study all suggestions carefully.
a. And beyond ideas shared in this house, we continue to engage widely to hear views from all Singaporeans.
b. We do so through participatory platforms, something that Ms He Ting Ru spoke about, like citizen panels, youth panels, and alliances for action. These platforms are resource-intensive. They take a lot of time, but we find them useful, and we will plan to do more.
c. We may not be able to do implement every idea; there will be difference of views. And if we can't implement for whatever reason, we will explain why.
50. Our commitment, the Government's commitment, is that we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that every Singaporean feels supported at every life stage.
a. And the numbers, what we spend on, reflects this commitment. In fact, we spend more on social development than on the economy and security. Actually, social spending is already greater than what we spend on both the economy and security combined. So we are not saying we will do. We have done so in concrete terms.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
b. And we expect social spending to continue to grow in the coming years.
c. It's partly driven by our ageing population and rising healthcare costs.
d. It's also because of our efforts under Forward Singapore to strengthen our social compact. We have fleshed out many programmes in this Budget and the previous one. But as I said there will be more to come, as this is a multi-year effort.


## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

72. On the whole, we have achieved outcomes that reflect our values as a society - one that's fair and equitable, prudent yet progressive, where those who have more contribute more to uplift those with less.
73. And in this Budget, we did extend some measures to private property residents, arising from feedback from residents themselves as well as many

members. Mr Singh says that it is ""ironic"" that they should receive climate vouchers. But why is that so? 

Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.
iii. 

## E. Conclusion

Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

c. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future - artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals - are highly energy-intensive.
d. To meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power.
e. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.
59. One immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region.
a. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We've started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia, and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.
b. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.

60. But beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience.
a. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power.
b. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation.
c. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.
61. One established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power.
a. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010.
b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

62. We will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area.
a. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation.
b. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs.
c. Within the Government, we will reorganise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options, and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and costeffective way.
d. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.

63. Be it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure.
a. And that's why we established the Future Energy Fund last year.
b. I will top up the Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.
c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.

Determined to improve his family's future, he pursued part-time studies and earned an engineering degree, while juggling work and family responsibilities.
186. His children are now entering adulthood, at 17 and 22 . They have grown up in a more affluent Singapore, but they too face their share of challenges.
a. His daughter Jamie started at Singapore Polytechnic just as the Covid-19 pandemic hit.
b. Her school went online, and her daily activities were disrupted. But she did not let that get her down. She adapted and pushed forward, just as her father and grandfather had done before her.
c. I met Jamie and some of her fellow youth leaders back in 2022, after we had battled Covid-19 for two and a half years; they were optimistic, resilient and full of ideas about how they can contribute.

d. Since then, Jamie has graduated from Singapore Polytechnic as Valedictorian.
e. Today, she is pursuing her Bachelor's in Integrative Studies at SMU, while leading a non-profit to empower and support youths in tech. She hopes to work in the philanthropic sector to make a greater impact after graduation.
"
Is the government being overly conservative in its fiscal projections and plans?,"The government maintains that it is practicing responsible and prudent budgeting, ensuring that public finances remain healthy year after year. It spends within its means, raises revenues to meet new demands, and ensures that there are sufficient funds available rather than risking falling behind. The government also believes in using surpluses to fund future needs and provide more support for Singaporeans.","D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

# D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans? 

53. Finally: on a third issue, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans, especially in light of our surplus position?
54. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the treatment of SINGA and how it contributed to the surplus.
a. Under SINGA, we borrow for major and long-term infrastructure projects. The spending for such projects is capitalised, which allows us to spread the expenses across the useful life of the asset.
b. This, as we have explained, is more equitable as the asset will benefit both current and future generations.

c. This accounting treatment has been in place since FY2021.


Even as spending goes up, we will continue to keep within our means, and maintain a balanced budget over the medium term.
a. And that's why I don't see us being able to put back the amount we had drawn from Past Reserves during COVID (something which Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about).
b. But we will continue to be responsible and prudent with our finances.
c. And if we maintain this approach, our reserves should be able to keep pace with our economy, and we can continue to benefit from a steady stream of NIRC in our revenue stream.
69. Compare this with the fiscal situation in so many other advanced economies around the world, especially in the West.
a. They are running record levels of fiscal deficits; and their national debts are growing faster than their economies.
b. So the fiscal space they have to sustain their higher levels of welfare, while continuing to invest in defence and the economy, is shrinking.
c. And at some point, the reckoning will come.



## A. Introduction

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

3. The questions raised by Members during this debate revolve around three main issues:
a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

Let's dive deeper into the FY2024 projections because there were some questions raised about them.
a. Mr Louis Chua had filed a written PQ in September asking about the Overall Fiscal Position. Our reply referred to the figure reported in the Budget Book, which was also the figure provided in the Budget statement.
b. In fact, MOF only starts to put together the revised fiscal estimates around the December and January period, when we start to get more data to update our estimates.
c. And as I explained in the Budget statement, one key reason for the revenue upside was the unexpected increase in corporate income tax

collections.
d. Another reason, more generally, is that our economy performed better than expected.
e. Remember, in 2024, early 2024, MTI started the year projecting that the economy would grow at 1 to $3 \%$; we ended 2024 with GDP growth of $4.4 \%$ - well exceeding our expectations. But it's not just us. 

# Medium-Term Fiscal Outlook 

175. We will continue to keep an eye on our medium-term fiscal projections.
176. In 2023, the Ministry of Finance released an Occasional Paper showing that we expect to keep our fiscal position roughly balanced until 2030. For now, this remains our assessment. 

We achieve this by living within our means, and running a balanced budget over each term of government. This means spending prudently to meet our immediate and future needs, ensuring that our revenues cover expenditures, and keeping the tax burden as low as we can, while not burdening Singaporeans with debt.

But if we were to rewind the clock, and consider our situation, imagine what our situation was at the beginning of this decade.
a. We were in the thick of battle, fighting COVID.
b. I know it feels like a bad dream and a distant memory to all of us, but those were truly tough times. In 2020 alone, we had five budgets. In 2021 we had three budgets. We sought the President's approval five times to draw from Past Reserves.
c. And this is 2020, 2021. We had no way of knowing when the pandemic would end, how the virus would mutate, how many more new waves of infection we would face, how many more restrictions we have to impose, and how much deeper a fiscal hole we would end up with.
d. But we already knew for sure that spending needs would rise over the horizon. It was coming, year after year. Healthcare spending was rising,

especially with our rapidly ageing population.
e. We looked at different ways to raise revenues including through property and income taxes. But these moves were still not enough to cover the expected increase in expenditure, which was sure to happen.
59. So what should we do to plug the funding gap?
a. That's why we had to consider the GST increase.
b. It was a difficult decision. It was a difficult choice - it's never easy to raise taxes, and certainly not a tax like the GST.
c. But governance is about making responsible choices, not just popular ones. We must ask ourselves: Do we want short-term populism or longterm stability? Do we want to kick the can down the road or take the hard but necessary decisions?
60. So once there were signs that the economy had stabilised, we decided to proceed with the GST increase.
a. But we also rolled out a comprehensive Assurance Package, which effectively delayed the GST increase for the vast majority of Singaporean households.
b. Essentially, once we decided to move, the GST rates were locked in. But with the Assurance Package, we could be more responsive to changing circumstances. And we could push back effectively the impact of the GST increase.
c. And that's exactly what we did. We had multiple rounds of enhancements to the Assurance Package - to tackle cost-of-living concerns, and to ensure that the majority of households will not feel the impact of the additional GST for at least 5 years.

d. At the same time, we have a permanent GST Voucher, which we also enhanced, and this ensures that the GST and GST Voucher scheme, combined together, will support the lower-income groups and will protect them - not just over the next five or 10 years, but on a permanent and ongoing basis.
61. So with that in place, together with the other revenue moves we made, we are in a better position now. And now, the additional GST revenues have started to come in - and it's mostly, the revenues are mostly from those who are better-off, foreigners, as well as tourists. And it will give us the resources we need to improve our healthcare infrastructure, and take better care of our seniors.
62. What would have happened if we chose to avoid the GST increase because it is unpopular? Or if we did not enjoy the unexpected upsides in corporate income tax collections, which only emerged in the last two years?
a. We would have ended FY2024 in a deficit.
b. The projected balance in FY2025 would also have been a deficit.
c. And that would have meant less funding for essential services, less support for our seniors, and fewer resources to invest in our future.
d. Basically, Singapore and Singaporeans would have ended up in a much weaker position.
63. Several Members I know criticised MOF's fiscal marksmanship.
64. Look, when I started work in MOF decades ago, one of my main tasks was to provide fiscal projections. As an economist, that was what I did. I was one of those who would run the models, and churn out the figures. So I know exactly what this work entails and how difficult it is.
a. I will not defend the figures if they are off the mark.

b. But I will speak up for our MOF officers who do this work with dedication and professionalism against any unfair criticisms.
65. Ultimately, a budget is a projection - it is based on the best available information at that point in time.
a. We have to plan ahead. 

We have to make assumptions, and we have to decide how we deal with uncertainties.
b. In a crisis, when there is greater volatility in the economy, it is inherently more difficult to predict the turning points.
c. But if you set aside unexpected crises like COVID, our Operating Revenue projections have generally not been far off the mark - the average deviation over the 10-year period from FY2010 to FY2019 was within a reasonable range of $5 \%$.
d. On the latest two FYs, 2023 and 2024, the deviation has been larger, but still around $7 \%$, which comparable still to other jurisdictions like the UK and the Netherlands.
66. 

65. In most other countries, poor budget marksmanship is when a government severely overestimates the revenue it will collect, and underestimates its expenditure.
a. That's what poor marksmanship is about. That the Government makes unfunded promises that it cannot see through because there is no money; or it borrows funds from somewhere else and kicks the can down the road and leaves behind a growing burden for the next generation. But this is not the case in Singapore, where we practice responsible and prudent budgeting.

b. Ultimately, it is not just a matter of good marksmanship or poor marksmanship. It is a question of the right values and the wrong values; the correct fiscal principles and the wrong fiscal principles.
66. And the WP and the PSP may think that we are being overly cautious in our projections. But this government will never take risks with Singaporeans' lives and future.
a. We keep our public finances healthy year after year.
b. We spend within our means; and if there are new or additional areas of need, we raise revenues to meet these new demands.
c. We always ensure that we have enough rather than risk falling behind and falling short.
d. And should we have surpluses, that's good news. The money is not squandered, because it helps to fund future needs, and allows us to provide more support for Singaporeans. And the fruits of Singapore's progress will be shared with everyone, as we are doing in this Budget to recognise the collective effort of all Singaporeans.
e. Sir, that's the responsible way to steward and manage our nation's finances. We have 60 years of history to show that Singapore has abided by the right values and principles. And Singaporeans can count on this Government to continue doing the same.
67. We are in a fortunate position to have surpluses in FY2024 and FY2025. But on the expenditure side, I fully expect our spending to increase in the coming years.
a. Mr Leong commented that the monies are going into more and more endowment and trust funds, but in fact the majority of these funds are drawdown funds. In other words, the monies within these funds are going to be withdrawn and spent for upcoming needs.

b. Take for example Changi Airport. The monies that we set aside will be spent very soon, as the construction on Terminal 5 begins this year.
c. Changi Airport is owned by the Changi Airport Group (or CAG). It's not directly by the Government. And so the T5 project is not eligible for SINGA borrowing. Instead, CAG will borrow for the project, and the Government will be providing a guarantee to help lower borrowing costs, as I have explained in my Budget Statement. But if we want Changi Airport to remain competitive as a global air hub, CAG cannot rely on borrowing alone to cover the full costs of the project, and that's why the Government is providing significant support and funding through grants.

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech"
What are some of the key points raised by the members?,"Members have raised several key points during the debate. These include suggestions on supporting businesses and workers to navigate the new economic reality, helping Singaporeans cope with life's strains and stressors, and reassessing fiscal projections and plans. Additionally, there were concerns about high business costs, land prices, energy costs, labour costs, and wage increases. Members also suggested improvements in means testing criteria, addressing wealth inequality, and using alternative measures to assess wealth.","Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.
iii. 

And so these are issues we will continue to fine tune in terms of means testing criteria.
b. Ms Jean See, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlighted other groups that may need more support such as freelance and agency

workers, as well as working mothers.
c. Ms Usha Chandradas earlier championed for the arts, and Mr Ong Hua Han reminded us to ensure our arts and sports scene remains inclusive.
d. And Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Rachel Ong advocated for mental health issues.
e. These are some of the key points members have raised.


55. Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about the assets linked to the $\$ 3$ billion money laundering case, which have been surrendered to the state. These assets are progressively being liquidated and when they are liquidated, the monies will be added to the Consolidated Fund. These funds are not earmarked for specific purposes, and will be part of our overall revenues to fund the Government's budget.
56. Several members including Mr Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, Ms Hazel Poa, and Mr Leong Mun Wai questioned the need to increase the GST, given our strong fiscal position.
57. I should remind Members that we are in this strong fiscal position precisely because the Government took the necessary steps early in this term to raise revenues.
58. 

## A. Introduction

4. 

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

# Ensuring No One Is Left Behind 

46. This same approach applies to other areas, which many members spoke about.
a. For example, many MPs, Mr Vikram Nair, Associate Professor Razwana Begum, Ms Hany Soh, Mr Alex Yam, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Mr Louis

Ng, and Ms Carrie Tan, amongst others, spoke about more support for families, and support not just in financial terms, but also leave arrangements, which was a popular refrain from the speeches. We will have to look at all these suggestions.
b. Others like Ms Denise Phua, Mr Don Wee, Mr Ang Wei Neng, and Mr Sharael Taha have highlighted the need for more inclusive hiring practices and employment support for Persons with Disabilities. I agree we must do more for Persons with Disabilities. And in my Budget statement, I said we are embarking on a comprehensive study to look at post-18 pathways for people with disabilities, and we will want to do more for them.
c. Many members like SPS Eric Chua, Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Xie Yao Quan, and Mr Dennis Tan also spoke about the need to help our seniors age well and ensure they are not left behind in their silver years.
d. In fact we have made significant moves over the past 1-2 years to support these groups, including at this Budget.
e. But our attitude is we are never satisfied with the status quo, and will continue to review and study how we can make things better.
47. Likewise on the subject of caregivers, which many members spoke about, including Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Sharael Taha, Ms Ng Ling Ling, Ms Joan Pereira, and Dr Tan Wu Meng.
a. Caregiving arrangements vary from family to family - some have sole caregivers, while others will share the responsibility over several family members.
b. We recognise the crucial role caregivers play and the sacrifices they make, such as leaving employment to care for family arrangements, or forgoing their careers to spend more time to take care of their family

members. We want to provide support for those who have to take up this role, as it is not easy for them.
c. It is difficult to put a monetary value on caregiving. And furthermore, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to support caregivers. So our approach has been to provide support for the family as a whole.
d. And in this Budget, we have significantly enhanced the Home Caregiving Grant, and increased subsidies for care services in nursing homes and in the community.
e. But this not the end of our moves. In fact, we will study more to see how we can further strengthen our support for caregivers.

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

# A. Introduction 

Mr Speaker, Sir

1. I move that Parliament approve the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.
2. 2025 marks our $60^{\text {th }}$ year of independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.
3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:
a. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.
b. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

4. As a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges.
a. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant.
b. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.
c. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.
5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.
a. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.
b. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.
c. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.

6. Today, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.
7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.
8. 

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

But more importantly, let's look at the overall picture. We continue to have a highly progressive tax and transfer system.
a. Members are familiar with the benefits and tax ratios, which we highlight every budget. And it's worth going through them again.
b. The bottom quintile of households receives $\$ 4$ in benefits for every dollar of tax paid. Middle-income households also get more benefits than tax paid as you go through the income thresholds and levels.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
c. In fact, it's only the top quintile of income earners receives less in benefits, or 30 cents, for every dollar of tax paid. So this is what our system has achieved.
d. So these outcomes are a culmination of years of deliberate moves to enhance the progressivity of our overall taxes and transfers system.
75. There is no fiscal system in the world that can deliver perfect precision and equity. But I think we have found an approach in Singapore that works for us. It is not perfect, but we continue to make it better.

a. Here, everyone contributes to taxes. The lower and middle-income will receive more support, while the higher-income and wealthier segments of the population will contribute more. It's a fair and progressive tax and redistribution system, anchored on our values of a fair and just society.
b. And the strength of our fiscal system is internationally recognised. A recent OECD report commended Singapore on our robust fiscal system.
c. This is hard-earned credibility that we have built up over many, many decades. It is not something we should take for granted, because that same credibility can be quickly destroyed in the wrong hands.
76. And at the end of the day, something as fundamental as this, Singaporeans will decide.
77. Will they prefer a government that underestimates our needs, spends more from our hard-earned reserves, and leaves us weaker?
78. Or will they prefer a government that is steadfast, that upholds fiscal responsibility and discipline, and ensures we have enough resources for current and future generations to handle unexpected challenges?
a. Sir, the PAP's approach is clear: we take our duty as stewards of the country seriously. We remain true to our mission, and manage our finances carefully for the benefit of all Singaporeans, now and in the future.
b. We will continue to do our best to convince Singaporeans that ours is the right approach - it has served us well these last 60 years, and it will continue to keep Singapore on the right track in the years ahead.

# Strengthening Our National Identity and Our Community Bonds 

148. Our unity is a precious asset, which we must never take for granted. The experiences of countries around the world show how easy it is for trust to be eroded, and for societies to become deeply divided and polarised.
149. We must therefore remain steadfast in nurturing our cohesion and unity. And in this Budget, we will invest more in strengthening our cultural core and our community bonds.
150. We will introduce an SG Culture Pass, to encourage Singaporeans to attend arts and heritage activities.
a. All Singaporeans aged 18 and above this year will receive $\$ 100$ worth of credits, which they can use for eligible activities, like arts and cultural performances, museum exhibitions, and heritage experiences.
b. The credits will be made available from September this year, and are valid until the end of 2028.

c. The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth will share more about upcoming initiatives for the arts and heritage sector.
151. Our hawker centres and markets are an integral part of our way of life. This year marks over half a century since we built our first hawker centres and markets, and the fifth anniversary of the inscription of our Hawker Culture onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
a. To appreciate our hawkers and market stallholders, we will give each stall in centres managed by Government and Government-appointed operators a one-time rental support of $\$ 600$ this year.
b. We will also allocate up to $\$ 1$ billion over the next 20 to 30 years to upgrade ageing hawker centres and to build new centres. This will serve the changing needs of our stallholders and patrons. The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment will provide more details at the COS.

152. Sports is another avenue for Singaporeans of all races, religions and backgrounds to come together. Last year, we cheered on Team Singapore at the Olympics and Paralympics, rejoicing as our flag was raised high. We celebrate with them when they do well, and we encourage them when they face setbacks.
153. We are building new facilities in our heartlands, so that Singaporeans can enjoy sports closer to where they live. In the coming years, we will have new sports facilities in Toa Payoh, Punggol, and Clementi. And we are also upgrading existing facilities in Pasir Ris, Queenstown, and Hougang.
154. We will provide $\$ 100$ in SG60 ActiveSG credits for all ActiveSG members to enjoy sports together with their family and friends. You can sign up for the free membership at the ActiveSG website, and use these credits to book ActiveSG facilities and programmes.
155.

e. But this not the end of our moves. In fact, we will study more to see how we can further strengthen our support for caregivers.
48. 

Consider the experiences of our pioneers. Like Mr Yau Jon Kiang, who is 75 this year and a resident in Yew Tee. In our early years of nation-building, he and his wife worked long hours in a canteen at the Tanjong Gul Camp at Tuas. They put food on the table for the SAF, as well as their own young sons at home. Times were tough, but they persevered.
184. Their never-say-die spirit lives on in the family.

185. Jon Kiang's son, Joses, forged his own path to become a naval engineer with the SAF. He endured long stints at sea to serve and defend our nation. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

Our solidarity has seen us through many challenges, including our fight against Covid-19. We must continue to help our fellow citizens, and ensure we move forward together, as a people and a nation.

156. To encourage this spirit of giving, the Government provides matching funds that multiply the impact of donations. This year, we will increase our support for the fund-raising efforts of charities and social causes.
a. We will provide a $\$ 100$ million top-up to the Cultural

Matching Fund and extend it for five years until the end of Financial Year 2029.
b. The Government and Tote Board now provide dollar-fordollar matching grants for the fund-raising projects of Singapore-registered charities. We will provide a $\$ 270$ million top-up to this Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme, which will be extended for three years until the end of Financial Year 2027.

c. Many Singaporeans are passionate about social causes but may not have a specific charity in mind. The Community Chest, the Collective for a Stronger Society, and the President's Challenge provide platforms that help donors contribute to a range of programmes. We will introduce a \$250 million SG Gives matching grant to provide dollar-fordollar matching for donations made through these platforms. And to encourage sustained giving amongst larger donors, we will provide a higher $\$ 1.50$ in matching for donations with a minimum three-year commitment of at least $\$ 250,000$ per year.
d. In total, the Government and Tote Board will set aside more than $\$ 600$ million in matching funds to strengthen our spirit of giving.
157. Earlier, I had shared about the SG60 Vouchers. Those who are better off may want to donate their vouchers to those with greater needs. We will facilitate this, and we will share more on how to do so in due course.

# I. Conclusion 

180. Mr Speaker, 60 years in Chinese culture marks a full cycle of life. So in this SG60 year, we will complete one cycle, and we will enter a new phase of nation-building.
181. We must brace ourselves for new challenges in this next phase. There are dark clouds over the horizon. The world is in turmoil, and the situation is likely to get worse in the coming years.
182. But this is not the first time that Singapore has had to confront tough external circumstances. We've done so repeatedly over the last six decades, and so we can draw confidence from what we've been through together.
183. 

## Strengthening Our National Identity and Community Bonds

- Up to $\$ 1$ billion over the next 20 to 30 years to upgrade and build hawker centres

!

187. This is what the Singapore spirit is about.
188. At every turn, we have chosen determination over despair, innovation over stagnation, and solidarity over division.
189. Every generation has carved a path through its challenges, and paved the way for the next generation to go even further.
190. Budget 2025 sets out clear plans for us to continue this journey with confidence.
a. It is a Budget for the future - tackling immediate challenges, while laying the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient tomorrow.

b. It is a Budget for all Singaporeans. Because when Singapore thrives, every citizen benefits. Every Singaporean is supported from birth to old age, with more support given to those with less. No one is left behind.
c. Importantly, this is a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans - advancing our Forward Singapore efforts to build the Singapore we want, and empowering each of us to contribute towards our shared future.
191. The road ahead will not be without challenges, but I am confident that our best days lie ahead of us. Together, we can keep Singapore an evergreen oasis of stability, hope, and opportunity for all. So let us move onward together for a better tomorrow.
192. Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.
b. So we will introduce a new $\$ 1$ billion Private Credit Growth Fund.
c. This will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply.
53. As enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia.

54. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.
a. The Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to MOF, just in time for the Budget.
b. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets.
c. The Review Group will share more details on its measures in the coming days."
What measures are being taken to help Singaporeans cope with the strains and stressors of life?,"The Government is taking several steps to strengthen its social support system as part of Forward Singapore. These include providing greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs, such as education, retirement, healthcare, and housing. The Government also aims to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

Additionally, temporary help measures like CDC Vouchers are being provided to assist with the cost-of-living. A one-off SG60 surplus sharing package is also being implemented, which includes vouchers to offer some relief on the cost front.

Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing cost-of-living support for as long as needed and within its means. Structural programmes, such as education, skills training, and job training through SkillsFuture, are also being invested in to equip and empower Singaporeans, enabling them to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves.","## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.


# Supporting Singaporeans 

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

# Embracing Sustainability as a Lifestyle 

112. The Government is taking steps to green our energy and transport sectors, and to protect our island from climate risks. Singaporeans too, have a part to play in this. Sustainability is everyone's responsibility. 

We achieve this by living within our means, and running a balanced budget over each term of government. This means spending prudently to meet our immediate and future needs, ensuring that our revenues cover expenditures, and keeping the tax burden as low as we can, while not burdening Singaporeans with debt.

b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

# Building a Singapore Made for Families 

- \$500 Child LifeSG Credits for all Singaporean children aged 12 and below
- \$500 Edusave Account or Post-Secondary Education Account top-up for all Singaporean children aged 13 to 20
- Lower monthly full-day childcare fee caps in Governmentsupported preschools to reduce childcare expenses
- New Large Families Scheme
- \$5,000 increase in Child Development Account First Step Grant for each third and subsequent child born from 18 Feb 2025
- \$5,000 Large Family MediSave Grant to mothers' MediSave accounts for each third and subsequent child born from 18 Feb 2025
- \$1,000 Large Family LifeSG Credits annually to families for each third and subsequent child, in the years the child turns 1 to 6
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

159. Many businesses have also stepped forward to support their fellow Singaporeans in this SG60 year, and will be providing special SG60 discounts and offers. I would like to encourage more businesses to join in and offer their support.

160. Singapore is at its strongest when we stand together. We may have our differences. But we are all Singaporeans, living on this tiny red dot, as one family. When we rally together as one, there is no challenge we cannot overcome. And this unity is what keeps us resilient, thriving, and moving forward, even in an uncertain and troubled world.

## d. Every Singaporean aged 13 to 20 this year will also receive a $\$ 500$ top-up to their Edusave account, or their Post-

Secondary Education Account. They can use this top-up to pay for their approved education-related expenses.

24. More support will be extended to individuals and families who face greater financial stress.
a. We will increase the rates for the ComCare Assistance schemes, to better support lower-income households with basic living expenses. For example, a 1-person household on Long-Term Assistance will receive an additional $\$ 120$ each month, bringing the monthly cash assistance to $\$ 760$. Those supported by Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance will also receive more than before, based on the household's composition, needs, and income.
b. In tandem, we will increase the Singapore Allowance, which is an ex-gratia payment that some of our pensioners receive. It will increase from $\$ 350$ to $\$ 390$ each month, to support those with smaller pensions. And the monthly pension ceiling will also increase to $\$ 1,320$.
c. Through the ComCare Interim Assistance scheme, we will also provide more support for community organisations as well, to help households in need.

25. 

21. That's why we have been providing additional support measures over the last two years to cushion the impact on Singaporeans.
a. Last year, I enhanced the Assurance Package by $\$ 1.9$ billion.
b. The Package has helped to fully offset the effects of inflation for lower-income households, and to provide a significant cushion for middle-income households.

22. We will continue to provide support for as long as needed, within our means. While inflation is expected to ease further this year, prices remain high. Singaporeans are still adjusting to these new price realities. Some have had to tighten their belts, rethink spending habits, or make difficult trade-offs to manage their expenses.
23. Therefore, in this Budget, I will provide additional support for Singaporeans.
a. First, I will provide $\$ 800$ in CDC Vouchers to every Singaporean household.
i. The first $\$ 500$ will be disbursed in May this year. And the remaining $\$ 300$ will be disbursed in January next year.
ii. As with previous CDC Vouchers, half can be used at participating supermarkets. And the other half can be used at participating heartland merchants and hawkers."
How is the government supporting businesses and workers to navigate the new economic reality?,"We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments. We are also taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines. These moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.","# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

# Empowering Businesses 

![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)

We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

## A. Introduction

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

3. The questions raised by Members during this debate revolve around three main issues:
a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


## Supporting Workforce Transformation

- New SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant with up to 70\% funding support for job redesign
- Redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit with \$10,000 for eligible companies from second half of 2026 to offset out-ofpocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives
- Additional \$200 million for NTUC's Company Training Committee Grant to help more companies transform and upskill their workers"
How does the government justify the increase in social spending?,"The government justifies the increase in social spending by citing their commitment to ensure that every Singaporean feels supported at every life stage. They also mention that they spend more on social development than on the economy and security, and that this commitment is reflected in the numbers. Additionally, they attribute the growth in social spending to factors such as an ageing population and rising healthcare costs, as well as their efforts under Forward Singapore to strengthen their social compact.","51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

Sir, we are taking concrete steps to strengthen our social support system. In this Budget, l've focused on families, seniors and their long-term care needs, and persons with disabilities. But we will continue to review and update other policy areas over time. This is the Government's key priority. Because we want to build a Singapore where we have each other's backs, where no one is left behind, and where we continue to stay strong and united as one people.

49. We keep an open mind and study all suggestions carefully.
a. And beyond ideas shared in this house, we continue to engage widely to hear views from all Singaporeans.
b. We do so through participatory platforms, something that Ms He Ting Ru spoke about, like citizen panels, youth panels, and alliances for action. These platforms are resource-intensive. They take a lot of time, but we find them useful, and we will plan to do more.
c. We may not be able to do implement every idea; there will be difference of views. And if we can't implement for whatever reason, we will explain why.
50. Our commitment, the Government's commitment, is that we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that every Singaporean feels supported at every life stage.
a. And the numbers, what we spend on, reflects this commitment. In fact, we spend more on social development than on the economy and security. Actually, social spending is already greater than what we spend on both the economy and security combined. So we are not saying we will do. We have done so in concrete terms.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
b. And we expect social spending to continue to grow in the coming years.
c. It's partly driven by our ageing population and rising healthcare costs.
d. It's also because of our efforts under Forward Singapore to strengthen our social compact. We have fleshed out many programmes in this Budget and the previous one. But as I said there will be more to come, as this is a multi-year effort.


To be clear, this is not about Government spending. We are prepared to spend more where necessary.
a. But it's equally, if not more, important to get the policies right.
b. And to ensure the overall system is fiscally sound and sustainable.
43. And on that basis, we have been taking steps to progressively strengthen the key pillars of our social support and our social compact.
a. We started in Singapore with the basics: universal access to primary school for education; CPF for retirement; government subsidies and the 3Ms for healthcare; and HDB for housing.
b. And we've progressively enhanced these pillars - Workfare for lowerwage workers; Silver Support for the more vulnerable seniors; and SkillsFuture to support all our workers.
44. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

Members have offered many suggestions. Ms Hazel Poa said we need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations, and that we are overly reliant on the price mechanism, citing land as an example.
35. But pricing all resources properly is not about giving more weight to economic over social considerations; it's simply about getting our policies right and doing things the right way.
a. If we don't price properly, then we are giving a hidden subsidy.
b. A subsidy means someone has to pay. If it's not paid by consumers, it's paid by taxpayers. If it's not paid today, it will have to be paid tomorrow.
c. Because at the end of the day, there is no free lunch.
36. So our approach must be to get the price right. Then we decide how much to subsidise.
a. Take public housing as an example.
b. HDB has to pay the market price for the land when it develops a new flat.
c. But when it prices the new flat for sale, it doesn't recover fully the cost of the flat; instead, it prices it on the basis of affordability as we have said time and again.

d. I give you a concrete example. A 4-room BTO flat in Sengkang. This was in the October 2024 BTO exercise.
e. After accounting for grants, a resale flat nearby in that area is around $\$ 545,000$. Five years ago, it was about \$360,000Resale prices have gone up nearly $\$ 200,000$.
f. What about the sales price by HDB for a new flat? The BTO price has not gone up by that much. Instead, it has increased in line with median income over that period, and was sold at about $\$ 370,000$.
g. So resale prices have gone up a lot. BTO, yes, but not as much, and in line with median incomes.
h. The difference is a subsidy borne by the government.
i. That, together with the higher cost of construction, that is one of the key reasons why HDB's deficit has increased sharply. If you look at its annual statements, in FY2018 the deficit was $\$ 2$ billion. Now in FY2023 it's $\$ 6.8$ billion. And the Government's funding to HDB to cover its deficit has correspondingly increased over the years, to cover the deficit.
37. 

We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.


133. Many seniors prefer to age in place as much as possible, supported by their families and friends. They can opt for a range of care options. Some may use care services like day care or home care, while others rely primarily on family caregiving. We will also enhance support across the entire spectrum.
a. We will increase existing subsidies for long-term care services in the home and community by up to 10 percentage points, and similarly raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income to $\$ 4,800$.
b. And we will similarly introduce additional subsidies for cohorts born in 1969 and earlier by 15 percentage points.

c. We will also increase the subsidies provided under the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund to cover the rising costs of home healthcare items, like adult diapers, and to also cover additional categories of such items.
134. To better support those who are looking after seniors at home, we will enhance the Home Caregiving Grant. This is a cash grant which can be used to offset daily care costs.
a. We will raise the quantum for the Home Caregiving Grant. The maximum grant will increase to $\$ 600$ per month, from $\$ 400$ today.
b. We will also raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for the Home Caregiving Grant to $\$ 4,800$, so that more caregivers receive support.
135. We expect at least 80,000 seniors to benefit from the enhanced long-term care subsidies and grants, which will be implemented from next year. The enhancements are expected to cost around $\$ 300$ million in FY2026, and more in future years, as our population continues to age.

136. Besides higher subsidies, insurance will also play a part in easing the cost burden of long-term care. With a rapidly ageing population, we have to work hard to manage the increase in longterm care costs, and ensure a good mix of funding support between individual co-payment, government subsidies and insurance. We are studying this issue carefully, and the Minister for Health will say more at COS.

It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect. The higher collections were a result of Government action by injecting additional COE quota. This helped to bring prices down by 10 to $30 \%$ from the peaks in Oct 2023. But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


# D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans? 

53. Finally: on a third issue, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans, especially in light of our surplus position?
54. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the treatment of SINGA and how it contributed to the surplus.
a. Under SINGA, we borrow for major and long-term infrastructure projects. The spending for such projects is capitalised, which allows us to spread the expenses across the useful life of the asset.
b. This, as we have explained, is more equitable as the asset will benefit both current and future generations.

c. This accounting treatment has been in place since FY2021.


## Building A Fairer and More Resilient Tax System

163. In this term of government, we've made several significant changes to our tax system. These revenue moves give us the resources we need to meet our spending needs, and also make our fiscal system more progressive.
164. The GST rate increase ensures we have the revenues to look after our growing number of seniors, even with rising healthcare costs.

a. Through the Assurance Package, we have cushioned and delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households.
b. Importantly, we have designed our GST system with permanent GST vouchers. This ensures that lower-income households pay a far lower effective GST rate than higherincome households.
165. We also continue to ensure fairness and improve progressivity in our tax system. This means that those who are better off will pay more in taxes to help their fellow citizens.
166. That's why we raised Property Tax rates for all non-owneroccupied residential properties, which are mainly investment properties, as well as for higher-value owner-occupied residential properties.
a. The Property Tax rate changes coincided with a sharp increase in the Annual Values of properties, which arose because of Covid-19-related supply constraints in the property market.

b. We have therefore revised and updated the Annual Value bands of owner-occupier Property Tax rates for residential properties. And that means that more homes now fall within bands with lower tax rates.
c. To further cushion the impact, we provided Property Tax rebates. In November last year, we announced another rebate of up to 20\% for owner-occupied residential properties in 2025, capped at \$1,000.
d. Taken together, all HDB owner-occupiers and over 90\% of private residential property owner-occupiers will see lower Property Taxes this year.
167. 

While our revenues have increased, we have also spent more on Singaporeans. For example, we provided $\$ 3$ billion in MediSave top-ups in December last year, which will help to cushion the increase in MediShield Life premiums to fund better coverage and higher payouts.
172. We also earmarked resources for projects to boost economic competitiveness, including developing critical infrastructure like Changi Terminal 5, and for the energy transition.
173. Overall, I expect to end FY2024 with a surplus of $\$ 6.4$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.
174. For FY2025, I expect a similar fiscal position, with a surplus of $\$ 6.8$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP."
What factors are contributing to the expected growth in social spending?,"The expected growth in social spending is partly driven by the ageing population and rising healthcare costs. Additionally, it's also due to efforts under Forward Singapore to strengthen the social compact, with many programmes fleshed out in this Budget and the previous one, indicating a multi-year effort.","51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

# Building a Strong and Sustainable Social Support System 

33. These are desired outcomes which I'm sure we can all agree to. The question is how do we achieve them.
34. 

Sir, we are taking concrete steps to strengthen our social support system. In this Budget, l've focused on families, seniors and their long-term care needs, and persons with disabilities. But we will continue to review and update other policy areas over time. This is the Government's key priority. Because we want to build a Singapore where we have each other's backs, where no one is left behind, and where we continue to stay strong and united as one people.

To be clear, this is not about Government spending. We are prepared to spend more where necessary.
a. But it's equally, if not more, important to get the policies right.
b. And to ensure the overall system is fiscally sound and sustainable.
43. And on that basis, we have been taking steps to progressively strengthen the key pillars of our social support and our social compact.
a. We started in Singapore with the basics: universal access to primary school for education; CPF for retirement; government subsidies and the 3Ms for healthcare; and HDB for housing.
b. And we've progressively enhanced these pillars - Workfare for lowerwage workers; Silver Support for the more vulnerable seniors; and SkillsFuture to support all our workers.
44. 

While our revenues have increased, we have also spent more on Singaporeans. For example, we provided $\$ 3$ billion in MediSave top-ups in December last year, which will help to cushion the increase in MediShield Life premiums to fund better coverage and higher payouts.
172. We also earmarked resources for projects to boost economic competitiveness, including developing critical infrastructure like Changi Terminal 5, and for the energy transition.
173. Overall, I expect to end FY2024 with a surplus of $\$ 6.4$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.
174. For FY2025, I expect a similar fiscal position, with a surplus of $\$ 6.8$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.

# D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans? 

53. Finally: on a third issue, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans, especially in light of our surplus position?

b. This, as we have explained, is more equitable as the asset will benefit both current and future generations.

c. This accounting treatment has been in place since FY2021.


49. We keep an open mind and study all suggestions carefully.
a. And beyond ideas shared in this house, we continue to engage widely to hear views from all Singaporeans.
b. We do so through participatory platforms, something that Ms He Ting Ru spoke about, like citizen panels, youth panels, and alliances for action. These platforms are resource-intensive. They take a lot of time, but we find them useful, and we will plan to do more.
c. We may not be able to do implement every idea; there will be difference of views. And if we can't implement for whatever reason, we will explain why.
50. Our commitment, the Government's commitment, is that we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that every Singaporean feels supported at every life stage.
a. And the numbers, what we spend on, reflects this commitment. In fact, we spend more on social development than on the economy and security. Actually, social spending is already greater than what we spend on both the economy and security combined. So we are not saying we will do. We have done so in concrete terms.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
b. And we expect social spending to continue to grow in the coming years.
c. It's partly driven by our ageing population and rising healthcare costs.
d. It's also because of our efforts under Forward Singapore to strengthen our social compact. We have fleshed out many programmes in this Budget and the previous one. But as I said there will be more to come, as this is a multi-year effort.


D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

# Building a Singapore Made for Families 

- \$500 Child LifeSG Credits for all Singaporean children aged 12 and below
- \$500 Edusave Account or Post-Secondary Education Account top-up for all Singaporean children aged 13 to 20
- Lower monthly full-day childcare fee caps in Governmentsupported preschools to reduce childcare expenses
- New Large Families Scheme
- \$5,000 increase in Child Development Account First Step Grant for each third and subsequent child born from 18 Feb 2025
- \$5,000 Large Family MediSave Grant to mothers' MediSave accounts for each third and subsequent child born from 18 Feb 2025
- \$1,000 Large Family LifeSG Credits annually to families for each third and subsequent child, in the years the child turns 1 to 6
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

There have also been calls for us to make bolder moves on social policies.
a. And you can look around the world: there are many examples of social support arrangements that started with the best of intentions, but only ended up with more problems.
b. For example, some promise sizeable pension payments funded by

younger generations, but now have problems paying for them.
c. Others offer free universal healthcare, but now face rising cost and an overburdened healthcare system.
42.

156. To encourage this spirit of giving, the Government provides matching funds that multiply the impact of donations. This year, we will increase our support for the fund-raising efforts of charities and social causes.
a. We will provide a $\$ 100$ million top-up to the Cultural

Matching Fund and extend it for five years until the end of Financial Year 2029.
b. The Government and Tote Board now provide dollar-fordollar matching grants for the fund-raising projects of Singapore-registered charities. We will provide a $\$ 270$ million top-up to this Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme, which will be extended for three years until the end of Financial Year 2027.

c. Many Singaporeans are passionate about social causes but may not have a specific charity in mind. The Community Chest, the Collective for a Stronger Society, and the President's Challenge provide platforms that help donors contribute to a range of programmes. We will introduce a \$250 million SG Gives matching grant to provide dollar-fordollar matching for donations made through these platforms. And to encourage sustained giving amongst larger donors, we will provide a higher $\$ 1.50$ in matching for donations with a minimum three-year commitment of at least $\$ 250,000$ per year.
d. In total, the Government and Tote Board will set aside more than $\$ 600$ million in matching funds to strengthen our spirit of giving.
157. Earlier, I had shared about the SG60 Vouchers. Those who are better off may want to donate their vouchers to those with greater needs. We will facilitate this, and we will share more on how to do so in due course.

b. And we've progressively enhanced these pillars - Workfare for lowerwage workers; Silver Support for the more vulnerable seniors; and SkillsFuture to support all our workers.
44. 

We achieve this by living within our means, and running a balanced budget over each term of government. This means spending prudently to meet our immediate and future needs, ensuring that our revenues cover expenditures, and keeping the tax burden as low as we can, while not burdening Singaporeans with debt.

But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

65. In most other countries, poor budget marksmanship is when a government severely overestimates the revenue it will collect, and underestimates its expenditure.
a. That's what poor marksmanship is about. That the Government makes unfunded promises that it cannot see through because there is no money; or it borrows funds from somewhere else and kicks the can down the road and leaves behind a growing burden for the next generation. But this is not the case in Singapore, where we practice responsible and prudent budgeting.

b. Ultimately, it is not just a matter of good marksmanship or poor marksmanship. It is a question of the right values and the wrong values; the correct fiscal principles and the wrong fiscal principles.
66. And the WP and the PSP may think that we are being overly cautious in our projections. But this government will never take risks with Singaporeans' lives and future.
a. We keep our public finances healthy year after year.
b. We spend within our means; and if there are new or additional areas of need, we raise revenues to meet these new demands.
c. We always ensure that we have enough rather than risk falling behind and falling short.
d. And should we have surpluses, that's good news. The money is not squandered, because it helps to fund future needs, and allows us to provide more support for Singaporeans. And the fruits of Singapore's progress will be shared with everyone, as we are doing in this Budget to recognise the collective effort of all Singaporeans.
e. Sir, that's the responsible way to steward and manage our nation's finances. We have 60 years of history to show that Singapore has abided by the right values and principles. And Singaporeans can count on this Government to continue doing the same.
67. We are in a fortunate position to have surpluses in FY2024 and FY2025. But on the expenditure side, I fully expect our spending to increase in the coming years.
a. Mr Leong commented that the monies are going into more and more endowment and trust funds, but in fact the majority of these funds are drawdown funds. In other words, the monies within these funds are going to be withdrawn and spent for upcoming needs.

b. Take for example Changi Airport. The monies that we set aside will be spent very soon, as the construction on Terminal 5 begins this year.
c. Changi Airport is owned by the Changi Airport Group (or CAG). It's not directly by the Government. And so the T5 project is not eligible for SINGA borrowing. Instead, CAG will borrow for the project, and the Government will be providing a guarantee to help lower borrowing costs, as I have explained in my Budget Statement. But if we want Changi Airport to remain competitive as a global air hub, CAG cannot rely on borrowing alone to cover the full costs of the project, and that's why the Government is providing significant support and funding through grants.
68. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

# Securing Strong, Equitable Outcomes 

71. Sir, our system has also enabled us to achieve good and equitable outcomes.
a. The Government will continue to focus on accountability in spending - to ensure value for money in everything we spend.
b. And there are existing mechanisms in place to scrutinise our spending plans. I won't go through all of them, but we have well-established mechanisms to do so.
c. The Government continues to put out regular reporting of outcomes in the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review as well as KPIs in the Budget Book.
d. And as Mr Singh himself noted, we have put out occasional papers where relevant, for example, MOF's occasional paper on our COVID measures, our occasional paper on medium term projections, which I said we will be updating, as well as MTI's report card on the ITMs.
e. And we will continue to do so wherever useful.


Our solidarity has seen us through many challenges, including our fight against Covid-19. We must continue to help our fellow citizens, and ensure we move forward together, as a people and a nation.

156. To encourage this spirit of giving, the Government provides matching funds that multiply the impact of donations. This year, we will increase our support for the fund-raising efforts of charities and social causes.

And to encourage sustained giving amongst larger donors, we will provide a higher $\$ 1.50$ in matching for donations with a minimum three-year commitment of at least $\$ 250,000$ per year.
d. In total, the Government and Tote Board will set aside more than $\$ 600$ million in matching funds to strengthen our spirit of giving.
157. Earlier, I had shared about the SG60 Vouchers. Those who are better off may want to donate their vouchers to those with greater needs. We will facilitate this, and we will share more on how to do so in due course.



But more importantly, let's look at the overall picture. We continue to have a highly progressive tax and transfer system.
a. Members are familiar with the benefits and tax ratios, which we highlight every budget. And it's worth going through them again.
b. The bottom quintile of households receives $\$ 4$ in benefits for every dollar of tax paid. Middle-income households also get more benefits than tax paid as you go through the income thresholds and levels.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
c. In fact, it's only the top quintile of income earners receives less in benefits, or 30 cents, for every dollar of tax paid. So this is what our system has achieved.
d. So these outcomes are a culmination of years of deliberate moves to enhance the progressivity of our overall taxes and transfers system.
75. There is no fiscal system in the world that can deliver perfect precision and equity. But I think we have found an approach in Singapore that works for us. It is not perfect, but we continue to make it better.

a. Here, everyone contributes to taxes. The lower and middle-income will receive more support, while the higher-income and wealthier segments of the population will contribute more. It's a fair and progressive tax and redistribution system, anchored on our values of a fair and just society.
b. And the strength of our fiscal system is internationally recognised. A recent OECD report commended Singapore on our robust fiscal system.
c. This is hard-earned credibility that we have built up over many, many decades. It is not something we should take for granted, because that same credibility can be quickly destroyed in the wrong hands.
76. And at the end of the day, something as fundamental as this, Singaporeans will decide.
77. Will they prefer a government that underestimates our needs, spends more from our hard-earned reserves, and leaves us weaker?
78. Or will they prefer a government that is steadfast, that upholds fiscal responsibility and discipline, and ensures we have enough resources for current and future generations to handle unexpected challenges?
a. Sir, the PAP's approach is clear: we take our duty as stewards of the country seriously. We remain true to our mission, and manage our finances carefully for the benefit of all Singaporeans, now and in the future.
b. We will continue to do our best to convince Singaporeans that ours is the right approach - it has served us well these last 60 years, and it will continue to keep Singapore on the right track in the years ahead.

# D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans? 

53. Finally: on a third issue, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans, especially in light of our surplus position?
54. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the treatment of SINGA and how it contributed to the surplus.
a. Under SINGA, we borrow for major and long-term infrastructure projects. The spending for such projects is capitalised, which allows us to spread the expenses across the useful life of the asset.
b. This, as we have explained, is more equitable as the asset will benefit both current and future generations.

c. This accounting treatment has been in place since FY2021.
"
How does the aging population affect healthcare costs?,"The rapidly ageing population poses a significant challenge in managing the increase in long-term care costs. As more individuals age, they require greater support with daily living activities, leading to increased healthcare expenses. This trend is expected to continue, placing a strain on healthcare systems and necessitating careful planning and funding strategies to ensure adequate support for those in need.","D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

We have provided seniors more assurance for their retirement adequacy. We introduced the Majulah Package, to support all seniors born in 1973 or earlier. And we also enhanced the Workfare Income Supplement and the Silver Support Scheme.
127. Our priority is to empower our seniors to stay active and healthy. And that is why we rolled out Healthier SG and Age Well SG.

128. Our plans include creating a more conducive living environment for our seniors. Through the Enhancement for Active Seniors (or EASE) programme, we have significantly improved the mobility and safety of seniors through subsidised senior-friendly fittings and installations in HDB households.
a. These have been well-received by HDB residents.
b. We will expand EASE for three years up to 2028 to households living in private properties, so that more seniors can benefit.
129. As we get older, we are all likely to spend more on healthcare. To provide more assurance, we will introduce a five-year Matched MediSave Scheme.
a. The scheme will be made available to eligible lower-income seniors aged 55 to 70 years old.
b. For every dollar of voluntary top-ups received in their MediSave accounts, the Government will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant of up to $\$ 1,000$ per year.

c. So this will complement the existing Matched Retirement Savings Scheme.
d. Both matched savings schemes will help lower-income seniors, especially our grandmothers, mothers, and aunts who were homemakers and caregivers. The contributions from the Government and their loved ones will better support their retirement and healthcare needs, and give them greater assurance as they age.
130. While we will do our best to help our seniors stay healthy, the reality is that over time more of them will become frail and may require long-term care.
131. Currently, the Government provides significant subsidies for long-term care services, particularly for lower- and middle-income families. This is complemented by CareShield Life, which is our national long-term care insurance scheme, which provides a monthly cash payout upon severe disability.
132. 

133. Many seniors prefer to age in place as much as possible, supported by their families and friends. They can opt for a range of care options. Some may use care services like day care or home care, while others rely primarily on family caregiving. We will also enhance support across the entire spectrum.
a. We will increase existing subsidies for long-term care services in the home and community by up to 10 percentage points, and similarly raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income to $\$ 4,800$.
b. And we will similarly introduce additional subsidies for cohorts born in 1969 and earlier by 15 percentage points.

c. We will also increase the subsidies provided under the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund to cover the rising costs of home healthcare items, like adult diapers, and to also cover additional categories of such items.
134. To better support those who are looking after seniors at home, we will enhance the Home Caregiving Grant. This is a cash grant which can be used to offset daily care costs.
a. We will raise the quantum for the Home Caregiving Grant. The maximum grant will increase to $\$ 600$ per month, from $\$ 400$ today.
b. We will also raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for the Home Caregiving Grant to $\$ 4,800$, so that more caregivers receive support.
135. We expect at least 80,000 seniors to benefit from the enhanced long-term care subsidies and grants, which will be implemented from next year. The enhancements are expected to cost around $\$ 300$ million in FY2026, and more in future years, as our population continues to age.

136. Besides higher subsidies, insurance will also play a part in easing the cost burden of long-term care. With a rapidly ageing population, we have to work hard to manage the increase in longterm care costs, and ensure a good mix of funding support between individual co-payment, government subsidies and insurance. We are studying this issue carefully, and the Minister for Health will say more at COS.

We will increase our support for seniors with more severe care needs and who may require residential care, such as in a nursing home.

a. We will increase existing subsidies for residential long-term care services by up to 15 percentage points. We will also raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income to $\$ 4,800$.
b. Many in the older cohorts, especially those born in 1969 or earlier, do not benefit from CareShield Life, and therefore will face higher out-of-pocket costs. For this group, we will introduce additional subsidies of five percentage points.


## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

But if we were to rewind the clock, and consider our situation, imagine what our situation was at the beginning of this decade.
a. We were in the thick of battle, fighting COVID.
b. I know it feels like a bad dream and a distant memory to all of us, but those were truly tough times. In 2020 alone, we had five budgets. In 2021 we had three budgets. We sought the President's approval five times to draw from Past Reserves.
c. And this is 2020, 2021. We had no way of knowing when the pandemic would end, how the virus would mutate, how many more new waves of infection we would face, how many more restrictions we have to impose, and how much deeper a fiscal hole we would end up with.
d. But we already knew for sure that spending needs would rise over the horizon. It was coming, year after year. Healthcare spending was rising,

especially with our rapidly ageing population.
e. We looked at different ways to raise revenues including through property and income taxes. But these moves were still not enough to cover the expected increase in expenditure, which was sure to happen.
59. So what should we do to plug the funding gap?
a. That's why we had to consider the GST increase.
b. It was a difficult decision. It was a difficult choice - it's never easy to raise taxes, and certainly not a tax like the GST.
c. But governance is about making responsible choices, not just popular ones. We must ask ourselves: Do we want short-term populism or longterm stability? Do we want to kick the can down the road or take the hard but necessary decisions?
60. So once there were signs that the economy had stabilised, we decided to proceed with the GST increase.
a. But we also rolled out a comprehensive Assurance Package, which effectively delayed the GST increase for the vast majority of Singaporean households.
b. Essentially, once we decided to move, the GST rates were locked in. But with the Assurance Package, we could be more responsive to changing circumstances. And we could push back effectively the impact of the GST increase.
c. And that's exactly what we did. We had multiple rounds of enhancements to the Assurance Package - to tackle cost-of-living concerns, and to ensure that the majority of households will not feel the impact of the additional GST for at least 5 years.

d. At the same time, we have a permanent GST Voucher, which we also enhanced, and this ensures that the GST and GST Voucher scheme, combined together, will support the lower-income groups and will protect them - not just over the next five or 10 years, but on a permanent and ongoing basis.
61. So with that in place, together with the other revenue moves we made, we are in a better position now. And now, the additional GST revenues have started to come in - and it's mostly, the revenues are mostly from those who are better-off, foreigners, as well as tourists. And it will give us the resources we need to improve our healthcare infrastructure, and take better care of our seniors.
62. What would have happened if we chose to avoid the GST increase because it is unpopular? Or if we did not enjoy the unexpected upsides in corporate income tax collections, which only emerged in the last two years?
a. We would have ended FY2024 in a deficit.
b. The projected balance in FY2025 would also have been a deficit.
c. And that would have meant less funding for essential services, less support for our seniors, and fewer resources to invest in our future.
d. Basically, Singapore and Singaporeans would have ended up in a much weaker position.
63. Several Members I know criticised MOF's fiscal marksmanship.
64. Look, when I started work in MOF decades ago, one of my main tasks was to provide fiscal projections. As an economist, that was what I did. I was one of those who would run the models, and churn out the figures. So I know exactly what this work entails and how difficult it is.
a. I will not defend the figures if they are off the mark.

b. But I will speak up for our MOF officers who do this work with dedication and professionalism against any unfair criticisms.
65. Ultimately, a budget is a projection - it is based on the best available information at that point in time.
a. We have to plan ahead.

e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.
27. 

# Building a Singapore Made for Families 

121. While we provide targeted help for the more vulnerable groups, we will also do more to support all families across every stage of life. This begins with marriage and parenthood.
a. We have made significant moves in recent years, including enhancing the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and the Government's contributions to the Child Development Account (or CDA).
b. We have just enhanced paid parental leave to 30 weeks in total, which will enable parents to spend more time with their infants.
122. In this Budget, we will further reduce monthly full-day childcare fee caps in Government-supported preschools.
a. The fees will be capped at $\$ 610$ for Anchor Operator centres and $\$ 650$ for Partner Operator centres.
b. After basic childcare subsidies, a dual-income family will pay about $\$ 300$ per child. Lower- and middle-income families will pay less after additional subsidies.

c. So this reduction will keep full-day preschool expenses similar to those of the fees for primary school and afterschool student care combined.
123. Couples with more children often worry about additional costs, because the demands grow with each additional child. We will introduce a Large Families Scheme to support married couples who have, or aspire to have, three or more children. This will consist of three components.
a. First, a $\$ 5,000$ increase in the Child Development Account First Step Grant. This will apply to each third and subsequent child born from today onwards. The CDA monies can be used to defray preschool and healthcare expenses of the child and their siblings.
b. Second, a new $\$ 5,000$ Large Family MediSave Grant. This will be disbursed into the mother's MediSave account again for each third and subsequent child born from today onwards. And this can be used to offset the mother's pregnancy and delivery costs, or her family members' healthcare expenses.

c. Third, $\$ 1,000$ in LifeSG credits will be disbursed annually to families for each of their third and subsequent children, during the years that the child turns one to six. And this can help to defray a wide range of household expenses.
"
What is the purpose of the Forward Singapore initiative?,"The purpose of the Forward Singapore initiative is to strengthen the social compact by promoting shared responsibility, supporting one another, caring for those in need, and lifting each other up. This aims to build a more inclusive, stronger, and united society where every Singaporean feels valued and supported.","# F. Nurturing a Caring and Inclusive Society 

115. A major part of our Forward Singapore agenda is to nurture a more caring and inclusive society - one where every Singaporean feels valued and supported, regardless of age, ability, and circumstance. 

Now the baton has been passed to us. It is our turn to take Singapore forward.

The world is in flux, and uncertainties abound. To tackle the challenges ahead, we must stay united and work together as one.

Forward Singapore provides a roadmap for our next phase. It involves major resets in our policies and our mindsets to strengthen our social compact.

Budget 2025 will advance this agenda. It is a Budget for all Singaporeans. It is a Budget shaped together with all of you.

We will tackle cost pressures, and provide stronger support for families, seniors, and vulnerable groups.

We will advance our growth frontier by fostering innovation, expanding access to clean energy, and ensuring our workers have the skills to realise their full potential.

We will build a sustainable city, and secure a better and greener future for all.

We will nurture a caring society and an inclusive home - one where every Singaporean feels valued and supported.

Let us rally as one united people and move onward together for a better tomorrow.

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

187. This is what the Singapore spirit is about.
188. At every turn, we have chosen determination over despair, innovation over stagnation, and solidarity over division.
189. Every generation has carved a path through its challenges, and paved the way for the next generation to go even further.
190. Budget 2025 sets out clear plans for us to continue this journey with confidence.
a. It is a Budget for the future - tackling immediate challenges, while laying the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient tomorrow.

b. It is a Budget for all Singaporeans. Because when Singapore thrives, every citizen benefits. Every Singaporean is supported from birth to old age, with more support given to those with less. No one is left behind.
c. Importantly, this is a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans - advancing our Forward Singapore efforts to build the Singapore we want, and empowering each of us to contribute towards our shared future.
191. The road ahead will not be without challenges, but I am confident that our best days lie ahead of us. Together, we can keep Singapore an evergreen oasis of stability, hope, and opportunity for all. So let us move onward together for a better tomorrow.
192. Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

இப்போது பொறுப்பு நம்மிடம் ஒப்படைக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. சிங்கப்பூரை நாம் முன்னெடுத்துச் செல்வதற்கான தருணம் இது.

உலகில், தற்போது நிலையற்ற, நிச்சயமற்ற சூழல் நிறைந்துள்ளது. எதிர்வரும் சவால்களைச் சமாளிக்க, நாம் ஒற்றுமையாக, ஒரு மக்களாகச் செயலாற்றவேண்டும்.
‘முன்னேறும் சிங்கப்பூர்’ திட்டம், நம் அடுத்தக்கட்ட நடவடிக்கைகளுக்கு ஒரு வரைவுத்திட்டத்தை முன்மொழிகிறது. நம் சமூக இணக்கத்தை வலுப்படுத்துவதற்காக, நம் கொள்கைகளிலும் மனப்போக்குகளிலும் ஏற்படவேண்டிய மாற்றங்களும் அதில் அடங்கும்.

வரவுசெலவுத் திட்டம் 2025 இந்த இலக்கை முன்னெடுத்துச் செல்லும். இது, சிங்கப்பூரர்கள் அனைவருக்குமான வரவுசெலவுத் திட்டம். இது, உங்கள் அனைவரோடும் இணைந்து உருவாக்கப்பட்ட வரவுசெலவுத் திட்டம்.

நாம் செலவுகளின் சுமையைச் சமாளித்து, மேலும் வலுவான ஆதரவை அளிப்போம் - குடும்பங்கள், மூத்தோர், எளிதில் பாதிப்படையக்கூடிய தரப்பினர் ஆகியோருக்கு.

நாம் புத்தாக்கத்தை ஊக்குவித்து, சுத்தமான எரிசக்தியை விரிவுபடுத்தி, நமது ஊழியர்கள் தங்கள் முழு ஆற்றலை உணரத் தேவையான திறன்கள் கொண்டிருப்பதை உறுதிசெய்து, நாம் நம் வளர்ச்சி வாய்ப்புகளை மேம்படுத்துவோம்.

நாம் நீடித்து நிலைக்கத்தக்க நகரத்தை உருவாக்குவதோடு, மேலும் சிறந்த, பசுமையான வருங்காலத்தை அனைவருக்கும் கையகப்படுத்துவோம்.

நாம் பரிவுமிக்க, அனைவரையும் உள்ளடக்கிய ஒரு சமுதாயத்தை உருவாக்குவோம் - அதில் ஒவ்வொரு சிங்கப்பூரரும் மதிக்கத்தக்கவராகவும் ஆதரவு மிக்கவராகவும் உணர்வர்.

ஒன்றுபட்ட மக்களாய் மேலும் சிறந்ததோர் எதிர்காலத்தை நோக்கி முன்னேறிச் செல்வோமாக!

But despite the uncertainties, we can look ahead with a degree of confidence. Singapore today is far stronger than we were 60 years ago.
a. We have developed a strong and well-diversified economy, supported by a highly skilled workforce.
b. We have built up a robust SAF and a strong diplomatic network, to uphold our sovereignty and security.
c. We have forged a common Singaporean identity, grounded in our shared values and experiences, and our commitment to one another and our nation.
14. This is the legacy of generations of Singaporeans, with each one running a good race. The baton has now been passed, and it is our turn to take Singapore forward. This Budget builds on previous Budgets, not only to address today's challenges, but to plan ahead and secure Singapore's future.
15. Budget 2025 is a Budget for all Singaporeans.

16. It's also a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans. It further advances our Forward Singapore agenda, which incorporates your aspirations and views, and seeks to keep our society strong and united.
17. In this Budget, we will work with you to:
a. Tackle cost pressures;
b. Advance our growth frontier;
c. Equip workers throughout life;
d. Build a sustainable city;
e. Nurture a caring and inclusive society; and
f. Rally as one united people.
18. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

# E. Conclusion

79. Mr Speaker, to conclude, the world is going through unprecedented changes. We are contending with tectonic shifts on multiple fronts - geopolitics and trade, technology and energy, demographics and culture.
80. Thriving amidst adversity is never easy but that's what the Singapore story is all about, from the very beginning. And we have strong foundations today that give us the confidence to move forward:
a. We have a strong fiscal footing, built up over years of careful stewardship by our forefathers.
b. We have a clear plan for the road ahead, anchored on our Forward Singapore agenda.
c. We are grounded in our shared values of solidarity and unity.
81. This year's Budget paves the way for us to chart Singapore's next lap - to navigate uncertainties with gumption and strength, to address immediate challenges decisively, and to secure our long-term future with confidence. It is a Budget put together by Singaporeans, with Singaporeans, for all Singaporeans.
82. So let us write the next chapter of our Singapore story and move onward together for a better tomorrow.
83. 

# Menyokong Rakyat Singapura 

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)
demi Masa Hadapan yang Lebih Cerah

49. We keep an open mind and study all suggestions carefully.
a. And beyond ideas shared in this house, we continue to engage widely to hear views from all Singaporeans.
b. We do so through participatory platforms, something that Ms He Ting Ru spoke about, like citizen panels, youth panels, and alliances for action. These platforms are resource-intensive. They take a lot of time, but we find them useful, and we will plan to do more.
c. We may not be able to do implement every idea; there will be difference of views. And if we can't implement for whatever reason, we will explain why.
50. Our commitment, the Government's commitment, is that we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that every Singaporean feels supported at every life stage.
a. And the numbers, what we spend on, reflects this commitment. In fact, we spend more on social development than on the economy and security. Actually, social spending is already greater than what we spend on both the economy and security combined. So we are not saying we will do. We have done so in concrete terms.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
b. And we expect social spending to continue to grow in the coming years.
c. It's partly driven by our ageing population and rising healthcare costs.
d. It's also because of our efforts under Forward Singapore to strengthen our social compact. We have fleshed out many programmes in this Budget and the previous one. But as I said there will be more to come, as this is a multi-year effort.


# C. Advancing our Growth Frontier 

32. We will take bold and decisive actions to advance our growth frontier.
33. The Singapore economy now operates at a higher level. But we cannot afford to stand still. Global economic competition is intensifying. And many other countries and cities are pressing ahead. If we fail to stay competitive, we will be left behind. We must therefore redouble efforts to grow our economy, and keep it dynamic and vibrant.
34. Growth has a direct impact on the collective wellbeing of Singaporeans.
a. Last year, our economy grew by more than $4 \%$. "
What strategies are being considered to navigate the uncertain global environment and create jobs for Singaporeans?,"The government is considering several strategies to navigate the uncertain global environment. One approach is to assess options as global tax developments unfold and adjust policies where necessary. This will help ensure that revenue streams remain stable.

Another strategy involves monitoring fiscal trends closely, updating medium-term projections, and spending responsibly while allocating resources effectively. If near-term fiscal upsides arise, these resources can be put to good use, including for social and economic needs.

Additionally, the government is taking proactive steps to maintain Singapore's position as a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. This includes working to stay open as a hub where businesses from around the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

Furthermore, the government recognizes its unique fiscal strength, which has been bolstered by investment returns. This competitive advantage is seen as vital in turbulent times, enabling Singapore to respond swiftly to potential shocks and turn adversity into opportunity.

By adopting these strategies, the government aims to create jobs for Singaporeans while navigating the uncertain global environment.","5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

# E. Conclusion

79. Mr Speaker, to conclude, the world is going through unprecedented changes. We are contending with tectonic shifts on multiple fronts - geopolitics and trade, technology and energy, demographics and culture.
80. Thriving amidst adversity is never easy but that's what the Singapore story is all about, from the very beginning. And we have strong foundations today that give us the confidence to move forward:
a. We have a strong fiscal footing, built up over years of careful stewardship by our forefathers.
b. We have a clear plan for the road ahead, anchored on our Forward Singapore agenda.
c. We are grounded in our shared values of solidarity and unity.
81. This year's Budget paves the way for us to chart Singapore's next lap - to navigate uncertainties with gumption and strength, to address immediate challenges decisively, and to secure our long-term future with confidence. It is a Budget put together by Singaporeans, with Singaporeans, for all Singaporeans.
82. So let us write the next chapter of our Singapore story and move onward together for a better tomorrow.
83. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

# Tackling Infrastructure and Resource Constraints 

55. Third, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in worldclass infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints.
56. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods, and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.
a. Development on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.
b. We have achieved islandwide 5G coverage, and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.



This is what economic dynamism and growth can deliver for our people. And so we will keep our economy strong and vibrant, and ensure that there are even more opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans - both now and in the future.

b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


177. There is still considerable uncertainty about how Government revenues will unfold over the coming decades.
a. At this juncture, it is too early to determine if the recent increase in Corporate Income Tax collections is temporary or a lasting trend.
b. There could be some additional Corporate Income Tax revenue from FY2027 onwards, with the implementation of the Domestic Top-up Tax, which will raise the large MNEs' effective tax rate to $15 \%$. But how much revenue we will get from this change depends on whether these MNEs continue to find it attractive to remain in Singapore.

c. Moreover, there is now great uncertainty about the global tax environment. The new US administration has withdrawn from the earlier consensus forged by the OECD and other countries. And it remains to be seen what further moves the US and other major economies will make in this new geopolitical environment.
d. So we will assess our options as global tax developments unfold, and adjust our policies where necessary.
178. Meanwhile, we are certain that expenditure will continue to rise. Government spending has been rising steadily over the years from about $15 \%$ of GDP to about $18 \%$.
a. And based on historical trends, we can expect our spending to go up to 20\% of GDP by around 2030.
b. With growing global uncertainties, and the need to invest more in our workers, and better support our rapidly ageing population, there will be added pressure to raise spending possibly at a pace that exceeds previous increases.

179. So we will continue to monitor fiscal trends closely, and update our medium-term projections. In the meantime, we will spend responsibly and ensure resources are allocated effectively. If and when there are near-term fiscal upsides, we will put the resources to good use, including for our social and economic needs. Ultimately, we will always ensure that all Singaporeans benefit from our nation's progress."
Which MPs have spoken about creating opportunities for Singaporeans in the current global climate?,"Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar have all spoken about navigating a very uncertain global environment to continue creating good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans.","5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans?

# E. Conclusion

79. Mr Speaker, to conclude, the world is going through unprecedented changes. We are contending with tectonic shifts on multiple fronts - geopolitics and trade, technology and energy, demographics and culture.
80. Thriving amidst adversity is never easy but that's what the Singapore story is all about, from the very beginning. And we have strong foundations today that give us the confidence to move forward:
a. We have a strong fiscal footing, built up over years of careful stewardship by our forefathers.
b. We have a clear plan for the road ahead, anchored on our Forward Singapore agenda.
c. We are grounded in our shared values of solidarity and unity.
81. This year's Budget paves the way for us to chart Singapore's next lap - to navigate uncertainties with gumption and strength, to address immediate challenges decisively, and to secure our long-term future with confidence. It is a Budget put together by Singaporeans, with Singaporeans, for all Singaporeans.
82. So let us write the next chapter of our Singapore story and move onward together for a better tomorrow.
83. 

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about.

Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.


# A. Introduction 

Mr Speaker, Sir

1. I move that Parliament approve the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.
2. 2025 marks our $60^{\text {th }}$ year of independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.
3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:
a. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.
b. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

4. As a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges.
a. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant.
b. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.
c. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.
5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.
a. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.
b. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.
c. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.

6. Today, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.
7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.
8. 

# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.

# I. Conclusion 

180. Mr Speaker, 60 years in Chinese culture marks a full cycle of life. So in this SG60 year, we will complete one cycle, and we will enter a new phase of nation-building.
181. We must brace ourselves for new challenges in this next phase. There are dark clouds over the horizon. The world is in turmoil, and the situation is likely to get worse in the coming years.
182. But this is not the first time that Singapore has had to confront tough external circumstances. We've done so repeatedly over the last six decades, and so we can draw confidence from what we've been through together.
183. 

# Supporting Singaporeans 

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)"
What are the main challenges mentioned in navigating the global environment to benefit Singaporeans?,"Navigating a very uncertain global environment requires addressing several key challenges. These include:

Weakening multilateral trading systems due to growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.

Countries focusing more on their defence and security interests, leading to zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

The need for strong industrial bases to sustain war efforts, which can disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.

Rising global disruptions and threats, including the possibility of conflict in Asia.

Ineffective global responses to these threats, which may not be as well-coordinated or effective as before.","5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

# Tackling Infrastructure and Resource Constraints 

55. Third, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in worldclass infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints.
56. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods, and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.
a. Development on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.
b. We have achieved islandwide 5G coverage, and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.



# E. Conclusion

79. Mr Speaker, to conclude, the world is going through unprecedented changes. We are contending with tectonic shifts on multiple fronts - geopolitics and trade, technology and energy, demographics and culture.
80. Thriving amidst adversity is never easy but that's what the Singapore story is all about, from the very beginning. And we have strong foundations today that give us the confidence to move forward:
a. We have a strong fiscal footing, built up over years of careful stewardship by our forefathers.
b. We have a clear plan for the road ahead, anchored on our Forward Singapore agenda.
c. We are grounded in our shared values of solidarity and unity.

181. We must brace ourselves for new challenges in this next phase. There are dark clouds over the horizon. The world is in turmoil, and the situation is likely to get worse in the coming years.
182. But this is not the first time that Singapore has had to confront tough external circumstances. We've done so repeatedly over the last six decades, and so we can draw confidence from what we've been through together.
183. 

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.
"
Why are participatory platforms considered resource-intensive?,"Participatory platforms are considered resource-intensive due to the significant investments required to establish and maintain them. This includes substantial investments in infrastructure, training, and ongoing maintenance to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability. The need for engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders also contributes to this intensity.","D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

# A Singapore Government Agency Website How to identify $\cdot$

49. We keep an open mind and study all suggestions carefully.
a. And beyond ideas shared in this house, we continue to engage widely to hear views from all Singaporeans.
b. We do so through participatory platforms, something that Ms He Ting Ru spoke about, like citizen panels, youth panels, and alliances for action. These platforms are resource-intensive. They take a lot of time, but we find them useful, and we will plan to do more.
c. We may not be able to do implement every idea; there will be difference of views. And if we can't implement for whatever reason, we will explain why.
50. Our commitment, the Government's commitment, is that we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that every Singaporean feels supported at every life stage.
a. And the numbers, what we spend on, reflects this commitment. In fact, we spend more on social development than on the economy and security. Actually, social spending is already greater than what we spend on both the economy and security combined. So we are not saying we will do. We have done so in concrete terms.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
b. And we expect social spending to continue to grow in the coming years.
c. It's partly driven by our ageing population and rising healthcare costs.
d. It's also because of our efforts under Forward Singapore to strengthen our social compact. We have fleshed out many programmes in this Budget and the previous one. But as I said there will be more to come, as this is a multi-year effort.

Overview

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

72. On the whole, we have achieved outcomes that reflect our values as a society - one that's fair and equitable, prudent yet progressive, where those who have more contribute more to uplift those with less.
73. And in this Budget, we did extend some measures to private property residents, arising from feedback from residents themselves as well as many

members. Mr Singh says that it is ""ironic"" that they should receive climate vouchers. But why is that so? 

## E. Conclusion

Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

c. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future - artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals - are highly energy-intensive.
d. To meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power.
e. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.
59. One immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region.
a. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We've started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia, and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.
b. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.

60. But beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience.
a. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power.
b. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation.
c. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.
61. One established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power.
a. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010.
b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

62. We will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area.
a. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation.
b. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs.
c. Within the Government, we will reorganise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options, and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and costeffective way.
d. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.

63. Be it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure.
a. And that's why we established the Future Energy Fund last year.
b. I will top up the Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.
c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.
65. 

This is not a cost-of-living support. It's an effort to encourage everyone to do their part to be more energy efficient.
74. 

Members have offered many suggestions. Ms Hazel Poa said we need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations, and that we are overly reliant on the price mechanism, citing land as an example.
35. But pricing all resources properly is not about giving more weight to economic over social considerations; it's simply about getting our policies right and doing things the right way.
a. If we don't price properly, then we are giving a hidden subsidy.
b. A subsidy means someone has to pay. If it's not paid by consumers, it's paid by taxpayers. If it's not paid today, it will have to be paid tomorrow.
c. Because at the end of the day, there is no free lunch.
36. So our approach must be to get the price right. Then we decide how much to subsidise.
a. Take public housing as an example.
b. HDB has to pay the market price for the land when it develops a new flat.
c. But when it prices the new flat for sale, it doesn't recover fully the cost of the flat; instead, it prices it on the basis of affordability as we have said time and again.

d. I give you a concrete example. A 4-room BTO flat in Sengkang. This was in the October 2024 BTO exercise.
e. After accounting for grants, a resale flat nearby in that area is around $\$ 545,000$. Five years ago, it was about \$360,000Resale prices have gone up nearly $\$ 200,000$.
f. What about the sales price by HDB for a new flat? The BTO price has not gone up by that much. Instead, it has increased in line with median income over that period, and was sold at about $\$ 370,000$.
g. So resale prices have gone up a lot. BTO, yes, but not as much, and in line with median incomes.
h. The difference is a subsidy borne by the government.
i. That, together with the higher cost of construction, that is one of the key reasons why HDB's deficit has increased sharply. If you look at its annual statements, in FY2018 the deficit was $\$ 2$ billion. Now in FY2023 it's $\$ 6.8$ billion. And the Government's funding to HDB to cover its deficit has correspondingly increased over the years, to cover the deficit.

They can write better programming code than many experts, assist in complex problemsolving, and even help to accelerate research breakthroughs.
69. Al will get better in the future, and other new disruptive technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant. That's why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning, and have made significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our social compact.

# Building a Strong and Sustainable Social Support System 

33. These are desired outcomes which I'm sure we can all agree to. The question is how do we achieve them.
34. "
What are the implications of the weakening multilateral trading system on global trade?,"The weakening multilateral trading system is likely to lead to a more fragmented and protectionist global trade landscape. This could result in increased tariffs and non-tariff barriers, making it more difficult for countries like Singapore to access international markets. As a small and open economy, Singapore may face significant challenges in maintaining its competitive edge and attracting foreign investments. The shift towards zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation could also lead to a decrease in global trade volumes and an increase in tensions between nations.","## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



All this has given us good momentum for our next phase.

10. But we expect greater global uncertainty and downside risks.
a. The US and China are locked in a fierce contest for global supremacy.
b. Neither side wants to come to blows. But both know that economic heft and technological prowess are key to winning this global race.
c. And both are prepared to take more assertive actions to advance their own interests, even at the expense of established international norms.
d. So we can expect escalating attempts at containment and counter-containment, with ripple effects that will inevitably draw in other countries, including Singapore.
11. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.
12. For 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook. Growth is projected at $1 \%$ to $3 \%$, while inflation is expected to average $1.5 \%$ to $2.5 \%$.

13. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

c. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future - artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals - are highly energy-intensive.
d. To meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power.
e. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.
59. One immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region.
a. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We've started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia, and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.
b. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.

60. But beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience.
a. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power.
b. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation.
c. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.
61. One established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power.
a. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010.
b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

62. We will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area.
a. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation.
b. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs.
c. Within the Government, we will reorganise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options, and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and costeffective way.
d. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.

63. Be it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure.
a. And that's why we established the Future Energy Fund last year.
b. I will top up the Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.
c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.
65. 

And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


102. There's still much more to do in the years ahead. We will:
a. Upgrade our homes and estates;
b. Refresh and rejuvenate our landscape and infrastructure; and
c. Importantly, prepare for a future of rising global temperatures.
103. Addressing the climate crisis requires strong international collaboration and collective action.
a. Unfortunately, momentum on global climate efforts has slowed.
b. This will make it harder for all of us to tackle climate change.

c. Despite these challenges, we remain resolute in our commitment to decarbonisation.
104. We will work with international partners and do our part to sustain efforts and drive meaningful progress.
a. Just a week ago, we submitted our new climate target to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
b. We have committed to reducing our emissions to between 45 to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035.
c. This will bring us one step closer to realising our longer-term aim of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

But more importantly, let's look at the overall picture. We continue to have a highly progressive tax and transfer system.
a. Members are familiar with the benefits and tax ratios, which we highlight every budget. And it's worth going through them again.
b. The bottom quintile of households receives $\$ 4$ in benefits for every dollar of tax paid. Middle-income households also get more benefits than tax paid as you go through the income thresholds and levels.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
c. In fact, it's only the top quintile of income earners receives less in benefits, or 30 cents, for every dollar of tax paid. So this is what our system has achieved.
d. So these outcomes are a culmination of years of deliberate moves to enhance the progressivity of our overall taxes and transfers system.
75. There is no fiscal system in the world that can deliver perfect precision and equity. But I think we have found an approach in Singapore that works for us. It is not perfect, but we continue to make it better.

a. Here, everyone contributes to taxes. The lower and middle-income will receive more support, while the higher-income and wealthier segments of the population will contribute more. It's a fair and progressive tax and redistribution system, anchored on our values of a fair and just society.
b. And the strength of our fiscal system is internationally recognised. A recent OECD report commended Singapore on our robust fiscal system.
c. This is hard-earned credibility that we have built up over many, many decades. It is not something we should take for granted, because that same credibility can be quickly destroyed in the wrong hands.
76. And at the end of the day, something as fundamental as this, Singaporeans will decide.
77. Will they prefer a government that underestimates our needs, spends more from our hard-earned reserves, and leaves us weaker?
78. Or will they prefer a government that is steadfast, that upholds fiscal responsibility and discipline, and ensures we have enough resources for current and future generations to handle unexpected challenges?
a. Sir, the PAP's approach is clear: we take our duty as stewards of the country seriously. We remain true to our mission, and manage our finances carefully for the benefit of all Singaporeans, now and in the future.
b. We will continue to do our best to convince Singaporeans that ours is the right approach - it has served us well these last 60 years, and it will continue to keep Singapore on the right track in the years ahead.

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

To achieve this, we must continue to uphold several fundamentals. That includes:
a. Maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies;
b. Harnessing market forces to drive efficiency and innovation;
c. Staying open to people and ideas to strengthen our capabilities;
d. And deepening our tripartite partnership as a cornerstone of economic stability.
36. At the same time, our approach and strategy must adapt to changing circumstances.
a. At this stage of development, we can no longer compete on cost alone. Instead, we must differentiate ourselves by producing high-value solutions for the world.
b. To take our economy forward, this Budget will emphasise three key areas: technology and innovation, our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our infrastructure investments amidst resource constraints."
How are countries prioritizing their defense and security interests in the current global climate?,Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests by shifting from win-win cooperation to zero-sum competition.

# A. Introduction 

Mr Speaker, Sir

1. I move that Parliament approve the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.
2. 2025 marks our $60^{\text {th }}$ year of independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.
3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:
a. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.
b. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

4. As a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges.
a. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant.
b. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.
c. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.
5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.
a. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.
b. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.
c. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.

6. Today, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.
7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.
8. 

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



# Menyesuaikan diri dengan Perubahan Iklim 

- Tokokan sebanyak $\$ 5$ bilion ke dalam Dana Perlindungan Kawasan Pantai dan Banjir
![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)

# Securing a Climate-Resilient Future 

109. As we do our part to reduce emissions in Singapore, we also have to assume the worst, and take steps to protect ourselves against climate risks.

a. If the world continues on a fossil fuel-based development trajectory over the coming years, global temperatures will keep rising, and that means we can expect a mean sea level rise of over one metre by 2100 .
b. Coupled with high tides and storm surges, the impact will be significant, well above one metre, and that means that around one-third of Singapore will be vulnerable to coastal flooding.
c. We are therefore developing and implementing plans to better protect our island.


# Adapting to Climate Change 

- \$5 billion top-up to Coastal and Flood Protection Fund
![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)

For a country, 60 years is a short time. But we have made great strides over this period, and there is much to be grateful for."
"Which groups did Ms Jean See, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlight as needing more support?","The Tripartite Workgroup aims to address the needs of various groups, including freelance and agency workers, as well as working mothers. These groups require additional support to improve Singapore's adult education and training system.","And so these are issues we will continue to fine tune in terms of means testing criteria.
b. Ms Jean See, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlighted other groups that may need more support such as freelance and agency

workers, as well as working mothers.
c. Ms Usha Chandradas earlier championed for the arts, and Mr Ong Hua Han reminded us to ensure our arts and sports scene remains inclusive.
d. And Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Rachel Ong advocated for mental health issues.
e. These are some of the key points members have raised.


# Ensuring No One Is Left Behind 

46. This same approach applies to other areas, which many members spoke about.
a. For example, many MPs, Mr Vikram Nair, Associate Professor Razwana Begum, Ms Hany Soh, Mr Alex Yam, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Mr Louis

Ng, and Ms Carrie Tan, amongst others, spoke about more support for families, and support not just in financial terms, but also leave arrangements, which was a popular refrain from the speeches. We will have to look at all these suggestions.
b. Others like Ms Denise Phua, Mr Don Wee, Mr Ang Wei Neng, and Mr Sharael Taha have highlighted the need for more inclusive hiring practices and employment support for Persons with Disabilities. I agree we must do more for Persons with Disabilities. And in my Budget statement, I said we are embarking on a comprehensive study to look at post-18 pathways for people with disabilities, and we will want to do more for them.
c. Many members like SPS Eric Chua, Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Xie Yao Quan, and Mr Dennis Tan also spoke about the need to help our seniors age well and ensure they are not left behind in their silver years.
d. In fact we have made significant moves over the past 1-2 years to support these groups, including at this Budget.
e. But our attitude is we are never satisfied with the status quo, and will continue to review and study how we can make things better.
47. Likewise on the subject of caregivers, which many members spoke about, including Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Sharael Taha, Ms Ng Ling Ling, Ms Joan Pereira, and Dr Tan Wu Meng.
a. Caregiving arrangements vary from family to family - some have sole caregivers, while others will share the responsibility over several family members.
b. We recognise the crucial role caregivers play and the sacrifices they make, such as leaving employment to care for family arrangements, or forgoing their careers to spend more time to take care of their family

members. We want to provide support for those who have to take up this role, as it is not easy for them.
c. It is difficult to put a monetary value on caregiving. And furthermore, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to support caregivers. So our approach has been to provide support for the family as a whole.
d. And in this Budget, we have significantly enhanced the Home Caregiving Grant, and increased subsidies for care services in nursing homes and in the community.
e. But this not the end of our moves. In fact, we will study more to see how we can further strengthen our support for caregivers.
48. 

Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.
iii. 

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

Consider the experiences of our pioneers. Like Mr Yau Jon Kiang, who is 75 this year and a resident in Yew Tee. In our early years of nation-building, he and his wife worked long hours in a canteen at the Tanjong Gul Camp at Tuas. They put food on the table for the SAF, as well as their own young sons at home. Times were tough, but they persevered.
184. Their never-say-die spirit lives on in the family.

185. Jon Kiang's son, Joses, forged his own path to become a naval engineer with the SAF. He endured long stints at sea to serve and defend our nation. 

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

144. 

55. Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about the assets linked to the $\$ 3$ billion money laundering case, which have been surrendered to the state. These assets are progressively being liquidated and when they are liquidated, the monies will be added to the Consolidated Fund. These funds are not earmarked for specific purposes, and will be part of our overall revenues to fund the Government's budget.
56. Several members including Mr Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, Ms Hazel Poa, and Mr Leong Mun Wai questioned the need to increase the GST, given our strong fiscal position.
57. I should remind Members that we are in this strong fiscal position precisely because the Government took the necessary steps early in this term to raise revenues.
58. 

51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.
b. So we will introduce a new $\$ 1$ billion Private Credit Growth Fund.
c. This will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply.
53. As enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia.

54. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.
a. The Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to MOF, just in time for the Budget.
b. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets.
c. The Review Group will share more details on its measures in the coming days.

# A. Introduction 

Mr Speaker, Sir

1. I move that Parliament approve the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.
2. 2025 marks our $60^{\text {th }}$ year of independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.
3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:
a. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.
b. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

4. As a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges.
a. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant.
b. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.
c. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.
5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.
a. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.
b. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.
c. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.

6. Today, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.
7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.
8. 

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

# Tackling Infrastructure and Resource Constraints 

55. Third, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in worldclass infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints.
56. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods, and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.
a. Development on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.
b. We have achieved islandwide 5G coverage, and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.



b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

# E. Conclusion

79. Mr Speaker, to conclude, the world is going through unprecedented changes. We are contending with tectonic shifts on multiple fronts - geopolitics and trade, technology and energy, demographics and culture.
80. Thriving amidst adversity is never easy but that's what the Singapore story is all about, from the very beginning. And we have strong foundations today that give us the confidence to move forward:
a. We have a strong fiscal footing, built up over years of careful stewardship by our forefathers.
b. We have a clear plan for the road ahead, anchored on our Forward Singapore agenda.
c. We are grounded in our shared values of solidarity and unity.
81. This year's Budget paves the way for us to chart Singapore's next lap - to navigate uncertainties with gumption and strength, to address immediate challenges decisively, and to secure our long-term future with confidence. It is a Budget put together by Singaporeans, with Singaporeans, for all Singaporeans.
82. So let us write the next chapter of our Singapore story and move onward together for a better tomorrow.
83. 

We also have considerable strengths in several industries.
a. We are a key player in semiconductors, supplying more than $10 \%$ of chips and producing one-fifth of semiconductor equipment worldwide.
b. Just as silicon chips fuel the tech industry, DNA chips are unlocking new frontiers in life sciences. These chips enable scientists to sequence DNA, which can be used to diagnose diseases or identify patient risks. They demand high levels of precision engineering, to implant millions of DNA strands onto a glass or silicon surface. Singapore alone produces more than $80 \%$ of the world's DNA chips.
c. In fact, we are a key node for the broader life sciences sector. Eight of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies have manufacturing operations here. We are also a major producer of advanced medical devices, including cardiac implants and hearing aids.

41. Take the example of American medtech company Illumina. It is the global leader in next-generation genetic sequencing instruments and DNA chips.
a. Illumina has a strong footprint in Singapore. We serve as its Asia-Pacific headquarters, and host a key R\&D and manufacturing site here.
b. This is Illumina's genome sequencer, which is designed and manufactured in Singapore. Engineers across different disciplines worked together to design this. When Covid-19 first emerged, it was such a machine that first sequenced the virus. It did so within hours, allowing scientists around the world to start developing drugs and vaccines.
c. Illumina's presence has benefited other Singapore enterprises, like Venture Corporation and Sunningdale Tech. Their partnerships with Illumina have helped them to build new innovation capabilities and expand to new areas.

42. 

And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

# C. Advancing our Growth Frontier 

32. We will take bold and decisive actions to advance our growth frontier.
33. The Singapore economy now operates at a higher level. But we cannot afford to stand still. Global economic competition is intensifying. And many other countries and cities are pressing ahead. If we fail to stay competitive, we will be left behind. We must therefore redouble efforts to grow our economy, and keep it dynamic and vibrant.
34. Growth has a direct impact on the collective wellbeing of Singaporeans.
a. Last year, our economy grew by more than $4 \%$. 

But despite the uncertainties, we can look ahead with a degree of confidence. Singapore today is far stronger than we were 60 years ago.
a. We have developed a strong and well-diversified economy, supported by a highly skilled workforce.
b. We have built up a robust SAF and a strong diplomatic network, to uphold our sovereignty and security.
c. We have forged a common Singaporean identity, grounded in our shared values and experiences, and our commitment to one another and our nation.
14. This is the legacy of generations of Singaporeans, with each one running a good race. The baton has now been passed, and it is our turn to take Singapore forward. This Budget builds on previous Budgets, not only to address today's challenges, but to plan ahead and secure Singapore's future.
15. Budget 2025 is a Budget for all Singaporeans.

16. It's also a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans. It further advances our Forward Singapore agenda, which incorporates your aspirations and views, and seeks to keep our society strong and united.
17. In this Budget, we will work with you to:
a. Tackle cost pressures;
b. Advance our growth frontier;
c. Equip workers throughout life;
d. Build a sustainable city;
e. Nurture a caring and inclusive society; and
f. Rally as one united people.
18. "
What measures is Singapore taking to enhance its competitiveness in the global market?,"Singapore is taking several proactive measures to enhance its competitiveness in the global market. These include extending support schemes for internationalisation, mergers and acquisitions, as well as launching initiatives such as the Enterprise Compute Initiative and the Private Credit Growth Fund. Additionally, tax incentives are being provided to support the development of Singapore's equities market, and a Global Founder Programme is being launched to nurture exciting ventures.","# Tackling Infrastructure and Resource Constraints 

55. Third, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in worldclass infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints.
56. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods, and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.
a. Development on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.
b. We have achieved islandwide 5G coverage, and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.



# C. Advancing our Growth Frontier

If we fail to stay competitive, we will be left behind. We must therefore redouble efforts to grow our economy, and keep it dynamic and vibrant.
34. Growth has a direct impact on the collective wellbeing of Singaporeans.
a. Last year, our economy grew by more than $4 \%$. 

## Strengthening Enterprise Ecosystem

- Extend support schemes for internationalisation, as well as mergers and acquisitions
- Up to $\$ 150$ million for new Enterprise Compute Initiative
- \$1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund
- Tax incentives to support development of Singapore's equities market
- Launch Global Founder Programme

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.

- சிங்கப்பூர் முதலீட்டுச் சந்தையின் வளர்ச்சியை ஆதரிக்க வரி ஆதாயங்கள்
- உலகளாவிய நிறுவனர் திட்டம் துவக்கம்

# Strengthening our Enterprise Ecosystem 

47. Second, we will strengthen our enterprise ecosystem.
a. Over the years, we have developed a stronger pool of globally competitive startups and enterprises.
b. But there is still more to be done.
48. We want Singapore to be a place where exciting ventures develop and grow into the leading enterprises of the future.

a. We already have a good pipeline of such promising enterprises. For example, AEM Holdings is a Singaporeheadquartered provider of semiconductor testing solutions. Its products serve a critical role in the chip production process, by helping to detect manufacturing defects or design flaws. AEM today has a global footprint, with manufacturing plants and R\&D teams across Asia, Europe, and the US.
b. We will provide more support for enterprises to scale up, execute their growth plans, and compete on the global stage. 

And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

## Navigating Global Challenges

# A. Introduction 

Mr Speaker, Sir

1. I move that Parliament approve the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.
2. 2025 marks our $60^{\text {th }}$ year of independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.
3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:
a. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.
b. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

4. As a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges.
a. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant.
b. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.
c. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.
5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.
a. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.
b. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.
c. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.

6. Today, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.
7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.
8. "
What are the concerns of key countries regarding technology leakage?,Key countries are concerned about keeping their proprietary technologies tightly controlled within a safe ecosystem.,"And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

c. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future - artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals - are highly energy-intensive.
d. To meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power.
e. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.
59. One immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region.
a. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We've started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia, and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.
b. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.

60. But beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience.
a. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power.
b. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation.
c. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.
61. One established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power.
a. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010.
b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

62. We will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area.
a. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation.
b. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs.
c. Within the Government, we will reorganise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options, and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and costeffective way.
d. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.

63. Be it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure.
a. And that's why we established the Future Energy Fund last year.
b. I will top up the Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.
c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.
65. 

Even as spending goes up, we will continue to keep within our means, and maintain a balanced budget over the medium term.
a. And that's why I don't see us being able to put back the amount we had drawn from Past Reserves during COVID (something which Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about).
b. But we will continue to be responsible and prudent with our finances.
c. And if we maintain this approach, our reserves should be able to keep pace with our economy, and we can continue to benefit from a steady stream of NIRC in our revenue stream.
69. Compare this with the fiscal situation in so many other advanced economies around the world, especially in the West.
a. They are running record levels of fiscal deficits; and their national debts are growing faster than their economies.
b. So the fiscal space they have to sustain their higher levels of welfare, while continuing to invest in defence and the economy, is shrinking.
c. And at some point, the reckoning will come.



## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

To achieve this, we must continue to uphold several fundamentals. That includes:
a. Maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies;
b. Harnessing market forces to drive efficiency and innovation;
c. Staying open to people and ideas to strengthen our capabilities;
d. And deepening our tripartite partnership as a cornerstone of economic stability.
36. At the same time, our approach and strategy must adapt to changing circumstances.
a. At this stage of development, we can no longer compete on cost alone. Instead, we must differentiate ourselves by producing high-value solutions for the world.
b. To take our economy forward, this Budget will emphasise three key areas: technology and innovation, our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our infrastructure investments amidst resource constraints.

We don't operate at the same scale as the US. But we can still excel in specific areas of innovation and technology.
a. We have a new generation of local tech companies like Grab, Sea and Razer, which have established themselves as regional or industry leaders.
b. We are home to the world's top tech companies. They already have substantial activities here, and are keen to do more out of Singapore, including in new frontier areas like artificial intelligence (or AI) and quantum computing.

40. 

Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.
iii. 

# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.


To enhance our technology and innovation engines, we have to anchor more high-quality investments. There have been attempts internationally through BEPS 2.0 to ensure that multinational enterprises (or MNEs) pay a minimum level of taxes worldwide, or to tilt the playing field in favour of governments. But in reality, MNEs wield considerable leverage and options. And that is why governments everywhere are still spending significant amounts to attract investments.
43. We cannot afford to outbid the major economies. But we do need to set aside sufficient resources to maximise our competitive strengths. So I will top up the National Productivity Fund by \$3 billion.
44. Our R\&D efforts are critical in powering our innovation and technology engines.
a. The Government has consistently invested about 1\% of GDP annually in R\&D over the last 20 years.

b. These investments have borne fruit. For example, our biotech ecosystem would not be where it is today without Biopolis, which we built more than 20 years ago. It also served as a platform for biotech talent to gather and share knowledge - knowledge that then diffused into our education system, which uplifted a new generation of Singaporeans.
45. To sustain this momentum, we must invest to keep our R\&D infrastructure at the cutting edge.
a. For our biotech sector, we will refresh our public biosciences and medtech research infrastructure in the greater one-north area. This will provide state-of-the-art facilities, promote collaboration within our research community, and enable faster translation of research into commercial solutions.
b. In the semiconductor space, we will develop a new national semiconductor R\&D fabrication facility. This will provide industry-grade tools for researchers and industry partners to prototype and test new semiconductor innovations.
c. These developments will cost about $\$ 1$ billion.

46. We will also support companies that undertake R\&D and innovation in partnership with other stakeholders. We have a good suite of schemes today, which we will further enhance. And more details are in the Annex to the Budget.

All this has given us good momentum for our next phase.

10. But we expect greater global uncertainty and downside risks.
a. The US and China are locked in a fierce contest for global supremacy.
b. Neither side wants to come to blows. But both know that economic heft and technological prowess are key to winning this global race.
c. And both are prepared to take more assertive actions to advance their own interests, even at the expense of established international norms.
d. So we can expect escalating attempts at containment and counter-containment, with ripple effects that will inevitably draw in other countries, including Singapore.
11. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.
12. For 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook. Growth is projected at $1 \%$ to $3 \%$, while inflation is expected to average $1.5 \%$ to $2.5 \%$.

13. 

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?"
What are the reasons behind major powers preparing for conflict despite stating they do not want it?,"The major powers' desire to maintain a strong industrial base is a key reason behind their preparations for conflict. This is because they recognize that economic heft and technological prowess are crucial in winning global supremacy, and a strong industrial base is essential to sustain any war effort. Additionally, the fear of being at a disadvantage compared to other nations drives this motivation.","## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

c. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future - artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals - are highly energy-intensive.
d. To meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power.
e. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.
59. One immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region.
a. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We've started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia, and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.
b. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.

60. But beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience.
a. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power.
b. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation.
c. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.
61. One established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power.
a. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010.
b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.
65. 

102. There's still much more to do in the years ahead. We will:
a. Upgrade our homes and estates;
b. Refresh and rejuvenate our landscape and infrastructure; and
c. Importantly, prepare for a future of rising global temperatures.
103. Addressing the climate crisis requires strong international collaboration and collective action.
a. Unfortunately, momentum on global climate efforts has slowed.
b. This will make it harder for all of us to tackle climate change.

c. Despite these challenges, we remain resolute in our commitment to decarbonisation.
104. We will work with international partners and do our part to sustain efforts and drive meaningful progress.
a. Just a week ago, we submitted our new climate target to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
b. We have committed to reducing our emissions to between 45 to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035.
c. This will bring us one step closer to realising our longer-term aim of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

For a country, 60 years is a short time. But we have made great strides over this period, and there is much to be grateful for.

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.
27. 

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

Even as spending goes up, we will continue to keep within our means, and maintain a balanced budget over the medium term.
a. And that's why I don't see us being able to put back the amount we had drawn from Past Reserves during COVID (something which Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about).
b. But we will continue to be responsible and prudent with our finances.
c. And if we maintain this approach, our reserves should be able to keep pace with our economy, and we can continue to benefit from a steady stream of NIRC in our revenue stream.

11. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.
12. For 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook. Growth is projected at $1 \%$ to $3 \%$, while inflation is expected to average $1.5 \%$ to $2.5 \%$.

13. 

And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

We have to make assumptions, and we have to decide how we deal with uncertainties.
b. In a crisis, when there is greater volatility in the economy, it is inherently more difficult to predict the turning points.
c. But if you set aside unexpected crises like COVID, our Operating Revenue projections have generally not been far off the mark - the average deviation over the 10-year period from FY2010 to FY2019 was within a reasonable range of $5 \%$.
d. On the latest two FYs, 2023 and 2024, the deviation has been larger, but still around $7 \%$, which comparable still to other jurisdictions like the UK and the Netherlands.
66. "
How is Singapore addressing the concerns about technology leakage while remaining an open hub?,"We are taking proactive steps to address these concerns. We welcome and harness technology from different countries, but we also lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws.","# Tackling Infrastructure and Resource Constraints 

55. Third, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in worldclass infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints.
56. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods, and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.
a. Development on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.
b. We have achieved islandwide 5G coverage, and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.



And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.

c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

We don't operate at the same scale as the US. But we can still excel in specific areas of innovation and technology.
a. We have a new generation of local tech companies like Grab, Sea and Razer, which have established themselves as regional or industry leaders.

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

# A. Introduction 

Mr Speaker, Sir

1. I move that Parliament approve the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.
2. 2025 marks our $60^{\text {th }}$ year of independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.
3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:
a. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.
b. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

4. As a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges.
a. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant.
b. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.
c. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.
5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.
a. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.
b. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.
c. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.

6. Today, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.
7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.
8.

Overview

# Supporting Singaporeans 

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

We also have considerable strengths in several industries.
a. We are a key player in semiconductors, supplying more than $10 \%$ of chips and producing one-fifth of semiconductor equipment worldwide.
b. Just as silicon chips fuel the tech industry, DNA chips are unlocking new frontiers in life sciences. These chips enable scientists to sequence DNA, which can be used to diagnose diseases or identify patient risks. They demand high levels of precision engineering, to implant millions of DNA strands onto a glass or silicon surface. Singapore alone produces more than $80 \%$ of the world's DNA chips.
c. In fact, we are a key node for the broader life sciences sector. Eight of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies have manufacturing operations here. We are also a major producer of advanced medical devices, including cardiac implants and hearing aids.

41. Take the example of American medtech company Illumina. It is the global leader in next-generation genetic sequencing instruments and DNA chips.
a. Illumina has a strong footprint in Singapore. We serve as its Asia-Pacific headquarters, and host a key R\&D and manufacturing site here.
b. This is Illumina's genome sequencer, which is designed and manufactured in Singapore. Engineers across different disciplines worked together to design this. When Covid-19 first emerged, it was such a machine that first sequenced the virus. It did so within hours, allowing scientists around the world to start developing drugs and vaccines.
c. Illumina's presence has benefited other Singapore enterprises, like Venture Corporation and Sunningdale Tech. Their partnerships with Illumina have helped them to build new innovation capabilities and expand to new areas.

42. "
How has China's share in global manufacturing output changed over the past twenty years?,China's share in global manufacturing output has more than tripled over the past twenty years.,"And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

All this has given us good momentum for our next phase.

10. But we expect greater global uncertainty and downside risks.
a. The US and China are locked in a fierce contest for global supremacy.
b. Neither side wants to come to blows. But both know that economic heft and technological prowess are key to winning this global race.
c. And both are prepared to take more assertive actions to advance their own interests, even at the expense of established international norms.
d. So we can expect escalating attempts at containment and counter-containment, with ripple effects that will inevitably draw in other countries, including Singapore.
11. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.
12. For 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook. Growth is projected at $1 \%$ to $3 \%$, while inflation is expected to average $1.5 \%$ to $2.5 \%$.

13. 

To enhance our technology and innovation engines, we have to anchor more high-quality investments. There have been attempts internationally through BEPS 2.0 to ensure that multinational enterprises (or MNEs) pay a minimum level of taxes worldwide, or to tilt the playing field in favour of governments. But in reality, MNEs wield considerable leverage and options. And that is why governments everywhere are still spending significant amounts to attract investments.
43. We cannot afford to outbid the major economies. But we do need to set aside sufficient resources to maximise our competitive strengths. So I will top up the National Productivity Fund by \$3 billion.
44. Our R\&D efforts are critical in powering our innovation and technology engines.
a. The Government has consistently invested about 1\% of GDP annually in R\&D over the last 20 years.

b. These investments have borne fruit. For example, our biotech ecosystem would not be where it is today without Biopolis, which we built more than 20 years ago. It also served as a platform for biotech talent to gather and share knowledge - knowledge that then diffused into our education system, which uplifted a new generation of Singaporeans.
45. To sustain this momentum, we must invest to keep our R\&D infrastructure at the cutting edge.
a. For our biotech sector, we will refresh our public biosciences and medtech research infrastructure in the greater one-north area. This will provide state-of-the-art facilities, promote collaboration within our research community, and enable faster translation of research into commercial solutions.
b. In the semiconductor space, we will develop a new national semiconductor R\&D fabrication facility. This will provide industry-grade tools for researchers and industry partners to prototype and test new semiconductor innovations.
c. These developments will cost about $\$ 1$ billion.

46. We will also support companies that undertake R\&D and innovation in partnership with other stakeholders. We have a good suite of schemes today, which we will further enhance. And more details are in the Annex to the Budget.

# I. Conclusion 

180. Mr Speaker, 60 years in Chinese culture marks a full cycle of life. So in this SG60 year, we will complete one cycle, and we will enter a new phase of nation-building.
181. We must brace ourselves for new challenges in this next phase. There are dark clouds over the horizon. The world is in turmoil, and the situation is likely to get worse in the coming years.
182. But this is not the first time that Singapore has had to confront tough external circumstances. We've done so repeatedly over the last six decades, and so we can draw confidence from what we've been through together.
183. 

# Helping Firms Transform 

10. As we navigate these external challenges, we also must continue to press on with productivity improvements in our own economy.
a. Our labour productivity has been growing at around $2 \%$ per annum over the past decade from 2014 to 2024.
b. Most of this is driven by the outward-oriented sectors of our economy.
c. So we can still do better to improve productivity for our domesticoriented sectors.


We also have considerable strengths in several industries.
a. We are a key player in semiconductors, supplying more than $10 \%$ of chips and producing one-fifth of semiconductor equipment worldwide.
b. Just as silicon chips fuel the tech industry, DNA chips are unlocking new frontiers in life sciences. These chips enable scientists to sequence DNA, which can be used to diagnose diseases or identify patient risks. They demand high levels of precision engineering, to implant millions of DNA strands onto a glass or silicon surface. Singapore alone produces more than $80 \%$ of the world's DNA chips.
c. In fact, we are a key node for the broader life sciences sector. Eight of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies have manufacturing operations here. We are also a major producer of advanced medical devices, including cardiac implants and hearing aids.

41. Take the example of American medtech company Illumina. It is the global leader in next-generation genetic sequencing instruments and DNA chips.
a. Illumina has a strong footprint in Singapore. We serve as its Asia-Pacific headquarters, and host a key R\&D and manufacturing site here.
b. This is Illumina's genome sequencer, which is designed and manufactured in Singapore. Engineers across different disciplines worked together to design this. When Covid-19 first emerged, it was such a machine that first sequenced the virus. It did so within hours, allowing scientists around the world to start developing drugs and vaccines.
c. Illumina's presence has benefited other Singapore enterprises, like Venture Corporation and Sunningdale Tech. Their partnerships with Illumina have helped them to build new innovation capabilities and expand to new areas.

42. 

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



For a country, 60 years is a short time. But we have made great strides over this period, and there is much to be grateful for.

# FY2024 and FY2025 Fiscal Position 

168. Let me turn to our latest fiscal position.
169. For Financial Year 2024, our revenue collections were better than expected.
170. A key reason is the upside in our Corporate Income Tax.
a. In the past, our Corporate Income Tax collections were quite stable, at about $3.2 \%$ of GDP.
b. But collections increased significantly in the last two years, and are projected to reach $4.1 \%$ of GDP in FY2024, which is quite significant.
c. This is an unexpected change. Corporate Income Tax is now the single largest contributor to total revenue - larger than even the Net Investment Returns Contribution (or NIRC).

d. There are several reasons for this higher Corporate Income Tax collection. Part of it is due to industry-specific cyclical factors, for example, in finance and wholesale trade. It could also be due to changes in the investment decisions of multinational enterprises, as they seek out stable and reliable centres like Singapore to put more of their high-end activities.
171. 

Let's dive deeper into the FY2024 projections because there were some questions raised about them.
a. Mr Louis Chua had filed a written PQ in September asking about the Overall Fiscal Position. Our reply referred to the figure reported in the Budget Book, which was also the figure provided in the Budget statement.
b. In fact, MOF only starts to put together the revised fiscal estimates around the December and January period, when we start to get more data to update our estimates.
c. And as I explained in the Budget statement, one key reason for the revenue upside was the unexpected increase in corporate income tax

collections.
d. Another reason, more generally, is that our economy performed better than expected.
e. Remember, in 2024, early 2024, MTI started the year projecting that the economy would grow at 1 to $3 \%$; we ended 2024 with GDP growth of $4.4 \%$ - well exceeding our expectations. But it's not just us. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?"
Why might small and open economies like Singapore be disadvantaged in the current global system?,"The current global system is characterized by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures, which have weakened the multilateral trading system. This shift towards zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation can disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore due to their reliance on international trade and commerce.","## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

All this has given us good momentum for our next phase.

10. But we expect greater global uncertainty and downside risks.
a. The US and China are locked in a fierce contest for global supremacy.
b. Neither side wants to come to blows. But both know that economic heft and technological prowess are key to winning this global race.
c. And both are prepared to take more assertive actions to advance their own interests, even at the expense of established international norms.
d. So we can expect escalating attempts at containment and counter-containment, with ripple effects that will inevitably draw in other countries, including Singapore.
11. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.
12. For 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook. Growth is projected at $1 \%$ to $3 \%$, while inflation is expected to average $1.5 \%$ to $2.5 \%$.

13. 

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


We don't operate at the same scale as the US. But we can still excel in specific areas of innovation and technology.
a. We have a new generation of local tech companies like Grab, Sea and Razer, which have established themselves as regional or industry leaders.
b. We are home to the world's top tech companies. They already have substantial activities here, and are keen to do more out of Singapore, including in new frontier areas like artificial intelligence (or AI) and quantum computing.

40. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger."
Why is it important for Singapore to stay open as a hub in today's fragmented world?,"In today's world, staying connected with the rest of the globe is crucial for economic growth and prosperity. A closed-off economy can lead to missed opportunities and reduced competitiveness. By remaining open, Singapore can foster a diverse range of businesses, ideas, and cultures, ultimately driving innovation and progress. This openness also helps to build trust among nations, making it easier to navigate complex global relationships.","And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

This is what economic dynamism and growth can deliver for our people. And so we will keep our economy strong and vibrant, and ensure that there are even more opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans - both now and in the future.

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.

# Tackling Infrastructure and Resource Constraints 

55. Third, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in worldclass infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints.
56. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods, and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.
a. Development on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.
b. We have achieved islandwide 5G coverage, and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.



13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.

d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


# E. Conclusion

79. Mr Speaker, to conclude, the world is going through unprecedented changes. We are contending with tectonic shifts on multiple fronts - geopolitics and trade, technology and energy, demographics and culture.
80. Thriving amidst adversity is never easy but that's what the Singapore story is all about, from the very beginning. And we have strong foundations today that give us the confidence to move forward:
a. We have a strong fiscal footing, built up over years of careful stewardship by our forefathers.
b. We have a clear plan for the road ahead, anchored on our Forward Singapore agenda.
c. We are grounded in our shared values of solidarity and unity.
81. This year's Budget paves the way for us to chart Singapore's next lap - to navigate uncertainties with gumption and strength, to address immediate challenges decisively, and to secure our long-term future with confidence. It is a Budget put together by Singaporeans, with Singaporeans, for all Singaporeans.
82. So let us write the next chapter of our Singapore story and move onward together for a better tomorrow.
83. 

159. Many businesses have also stepped forward to support their fellow Singaporeans in this SG60 year, and will be providing special SG60 discounts and offers. I would like to encourage more businesses to join in and offer their support.

160. Singapore is at its strongest when we stand together. We may have our differences. But we are all Singaporeans, living on this tiny red dot, as one family. When we rally together as one, there is no challenge we cannot overcome. And this unity is what keeps us resilient, thriving, and moving forward, even in an uncertain and troubled world.

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position.

# A. Introduction 

Mr Speaker, Sir

1. I move that Parliament approve the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.
2. 2025 marks our $60^{\text {th }}$ year of independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.
3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:
a. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.
b. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

4. As a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges.
a. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant.
b. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.
c. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.
5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.
a. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.
b. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.
c. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.

6. Today, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.
7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.
8. 

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).

How do Western countries perceive their position in terms of industrial base and war efforts?,Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage when it comes to having a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.,"## Navigating Global Challenges

Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

c. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future - artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals - are highly energy-intensive.
d. To meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power.
e. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.
59. One immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region.
a. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We've started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia, and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.
b. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.

60. But beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience.
a. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power.
b. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation.
c. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.
61. One established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power.
a. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010.
b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

62. We will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area.
a. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation.
b. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs.
c. Within the Government, we will reorganise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options, and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and costeffective way.
d. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.

63. Be it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure.
a. And that's why we established the Future Energy Fund last year.
b. I will top up the Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.
c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.
65. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



For a country, 60 years is a short time. But we have made great strides over this period, and there is much to be grateful for.

To achieve this, we must continue to uphold several fundamentals. That includes:
a. Maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies;
b. Harnessing market forces to drive efficiency and innovation;
c. Staying open to people and ideas to strengthen our capabilities;
d. And deepening our tripartite partnership as a cornerstone of economic stability.
36. At the same time, our approach and strategy must adapt to changing circumstances.
a. At this stage of development, we can no longer compete on cost alone. Instead, we must differentiate ourselves by producing high-value solutions for the world.
b. To take our economy forward, this Budget will emphasise three key areas: technology and innovation, our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our infrastructure investments amidst resource constraints.

All this has given us good momentum for our next phase.

10. But we expect greater global uncertainty and downside risks.
a. The US and China are locked in a fierce contest for global supremacy.
b. Neither side wants to come to blows. But both know that economic heft and technological prowess are key to winning this global race.
c. And both are prepared to take more assertive actions to advance their own interests, even at the expense of established international norms.
d. So we can expect escalating attempts at containment and counter-containment, with ripple effects that will inevitably draw in other countries, including Singapore.
11. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.
12. For 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook. Growth is projected at $1 \%$ to $3 \%$, while inflation is expected to average $1.5 \%$ to $2.5 \%$.

13. 

Even as spending goes up, we will continue to keep within our means, and maintain a balanced budget over the medium term.
a. And that's why I don't see us being able to put back the amount we had drawn from Past Reserves during COVID (something which Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about).
b. But we will continue to be responsible and prudent with our finances.
c. And if we maintain this approach, our reserves should be able to keep pace with our economy, and we can continue to benefit from a steady stream of NIRC in our revenue stream.
69. Compare this with the fiscal situation in so many other advanced economies around the world, especially in the West.
a. They are running record levels of fiscal deficits; and their national debts are growing faster than their economies.
b. So the fiscal space they have to sustain their higher levels of welfare, while continuing to invest in defence and the economy, is shrinking.
c. And at some point, the reckoning will come.



b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

To enhance our technology and innovation engines, we have to anchor more high-quality investments. There have been attempts internationally through BEPS 2.0 to ensure that multinational enterprises (or MNEs) pay a minimum level of taxes worldwide, or to tilt the playing field in favour of governments. But in reality, MNEs wield considerable leverage and options. And that is why governments everywhere are still spending significant amounts to attract investments.
43. We cannot afford to outbid the major economies. But we do need to set aside sufficient resources to maximise our competitive strengths. So I will top up the National Productivity Fund by \$3 billion.
44. Our R\&D efforts are critical in powering our innovation and technology engines.
a. The Government has consistently invested about 1\% of GDP annually in R\&D over the last 20 years.

b. These investments have borne fruit. For example, our biotech ecosystem would not be where it is today without Biopolis, which we built more than 20 years ago. It also served as a platform for biotech talent to gather and share knowledge - knowledge that then diffused into our education system, which uplifted a new generation of Singaporeans.
45. To sustain this momentum, we must invest to keep our R\&D infrastructure at the cutting edge.
a. For our biotech sector, we will refresh our public biosciences and medtech research infrastructure in the greater one-north area. This will provide state-of-the-art facilities, promote collaboration within our research community, and enable faster translation of research into commercial solutions.
b. In the semiconductor space, we will develop a new national semiconductor R\&D fabrication facility. This will provide industry-grade tools for researchers and industry partners to prototype and test new semiconductor innovations.
c. These developments will cost about $\$ 1$ billion.

46. We will also support companies that undertake R\&D and innovation in partnership with other stakeholders. We have a good suite of schemes today, which we will further enhance. And more details are in the Annex to the Budget."
How do the proactive moves help businesses operate with assurance and confidence in Singapore?,"These moves create an environment where businesses can thrive, knowing they have a reliable partner in global trade and commerce. This helps to alleviate concerns about disruptions or challenges that may arise from external factors, allowing companies to focus on their core operations and growth strategies.","And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


This is what economic dynamism and growth can deliver for our people. And so we will keep our economy strong and vibrant, and ensure that there are even more opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans - both now and in the future.

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

159. Many businesses have also stepped forward to support their fellow Singaporeans in this SG60 year, and will be providing special SG60 discounts and offers. I would like to encourage more businesses to join in and offer their support.

160. Singapore is at its strongest when we stand together. We may have our differences. But we are all Singaporeans, living on this tiny red dot, as one family. When we rally together as one, there is no challenge we cannot overcome. And this unity is what keeps us resilient, thriving, and moving forward, even in an uncertain and troubled world.

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

# C. Advancing our Growth Frontier 

32. We will take bold and decisive actions to advance our growth frontier.
33. The Singapore economy now operates at a higher level. But we cannot afford to stand still. Global economic competition is intensifying. And many other countries and cities are pressing ahead. If we fail to stay competitive, we will be left behind. We must therefore redouble efforts to grow our economy, and keep it dynamic and vibrant.
34. Growth has a direct impact on the collective wellbeing of Singaporeans.
a. Last year, our economy grew by more than $4 \%$. 

But despite the uncertainties, we can look ahead with a degree of confidence. Singapore today is far stronger than we were 60 years ago.
a. We have developed a strong and well-diversified economy, supported by a highly skilled workforce.
b. We have built up a robust SAF and a strong diplomatic network, to uphold our sovereignty and security.
c. We have forged a common Singaporean identity, grounded in our shared values and experiences, and our commitment to one another and our nation.
14. This is the legacy of generations of Singaporeans, with each one running a good race. The baton has now been passed, and it is our turn to take Singapore forward. This Budget builds on previous Budgets, not only to address today's challenges, but to plan ahead and secure Singapore's future.
15. Budget 2025 is a Budget for all Singaporeans.

16. It's also a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans. It further advances our Forward Singapore agenda, which incorporates your aspirations and views, and seeks to keep our society strong and united.
17. In this Budget, we will work with you to:
a. Tackle cost pressures;
b. Advance our growth frontier;
c. Equip workers throughout life;
d. Build a sustainable city;
e. Nurture a caring and inclusive society; and
f. Rally as one united people.
18. 

# Strengthening our Enterprise Ecosystem 

47. Second, we will strengthen our enterprise ecosystem.
a. Over the years, we have developed a stronger pool of globally competitive startups and enterprises.
b. But there is still more to be done.
48. We want Singapore to be a place where exciting ventures develop and grow into the leading enterprises of the future.

a. We already have a good pipeline of such promising enterprises. For example, AEM Holdings is a Singaporeheadquartered provider of semiconductor testing solutions. Its products serve a critical role in the chip production process, by helping to detect manufacturing defects or design flaws. AEM today has a global footprint, with manufacturing plants and R\&D teams across Asia, Europe, and the US.
b. We will provide more support for enterprises to scale up, execute their growth plans, and compete on the global stage. 

We achieve this by living within our means, and running a balanced budget over each term of government. This means spending prudently to meet our immediate and future needs, ensuring that our revenues cover expenditures, and keeping the tax burden as low as we can, while not burdening Singaporeans with debt.

b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?"
What has been the annual growth rate of labor productivity over the past decade?,$2\%$ per annum.,"# Helping Firms Transform 

10. As we navigate these external challenges, we also must continue to press on with productivity improvements in our own economy.
a. Our labour productivity has been growing at around $2 \%$ per annum over the past decade from 2014 to 2024.
b. Most of this is driven by the outward-oriented sectors of our economy.
c. So we can still do better to improve productivity for our domesticoriented sectors.


11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
9. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

For a country, 60 years is a short time. But we have made great strides over this period, and there is much to be grateful for.

This meant higher wages and real incomes for many, many workers.
b. It will be hard to achieve $4 \%$ growth on a sustained basis. But if we can secure an average of $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ growth per annum over the next decade, we will be able to create better jobs and opportunities, and improve standards of living for all Singaporeans.

35. 

# D. Equipping Workers Throughout Life 

67. A growing economy creates more well-paying jobs. But the jobs of the future will not be the same as the jobs of today. Rapid technological advances, especially in Al, will transform workplaces and jobs.
68. Just a few years ago, tools like ChatGPT didn't even exist. Now there is a rapidly expanding ecosystem of Al models. They can generate high-quality text, images, and videos. 

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

c. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future - artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals - are highly energy-intensive.
d. To meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power.
e. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.
59. One immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region.
a. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We've started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia, and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.
b. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.

60. But beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience.
a. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power.
b. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation.
c. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.
61. One established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power.
a. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010.
b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

62. We will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area.
a. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation.
b. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs.
c. Within the Government, we will reorganise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options, and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and costeffective way.
d. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.

63. Be it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure.
a. And that's why we established the Future Energy Fund last year.
b. I will top up the Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.
c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.
65. 

30. As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.
a. That remains the key thrust of our approach.
b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.
c. Singaporean households - across different income levels - have experienced sustained real income growth over the past decade. And

what we have achieved has outperformed many other advanced economies, as you can see from this chart.

What can be done to improve productivity in domestic-oriented sectors?,"Continuing to press on with productivity improvements is essential for our economy. One way to do this is by investing in technology solutions that cater to the needs of domestic-oriented sectors. This could involve adopting off-the-shelf solutions like analytics and digital marketing tools, as well as exploring tailored AI solutions that can be integrated into business processes and systems.","# Helping Firms Transform

But in reality, MNEs wield considerable leverage and options. And that is why governments everywhere are still spending significant amounts to attract investments.
43. We cannot afford to outbid the major economies. But we do need to set aside sufficient resources to maximise our competitive strengths. So I will top up the National Productivity Fund by \$3 billion.
44. Our R\&D efforts are critical in powering our innovation and technology engines.
a. The Government has consistently invested about 1\% of GDP annually in R\&D over the last 20 years.

46. We will also support companies that undertake R\&D and innovation in partnership with other stakeholders. We have a good suite of schemes today, which we will further enhance. And more details are in the Annex to the Budget.

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



To succeed, all enterprises must invest in technology to enhance their competitiveness and productivity. Enterprises can adopt off-the-shelf solutions like Al-powered analytics and digital marketing tools. We will continue to encourage the adoption of such solutions through initiatives like the Productivity Solutions Grant and the SMEs Go Digital.
50. Beyond a certain stage, enterprises will need Al solutions, which are tailored to their needs and integrated into their business processes and systems. To support this, I will set aside up to $\$ 150$ million for a new Enterprise Compute Initiative. Under this initiative, eligible enterprises will be partnered with major cloud service providers to access Al tools and computing power, as well as expert consultancy services. This will help enterprises leverage Al more effectively in their transformation journey.

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.

# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.
"
Which sectors have primarily driven the growth in labor productivity?,Outward-oriented sectors of our economy.,"# Helping Firms Transform 

10. As we navigate these external challenges, we also must continue to press on with productivity improvements in our own economy.
a. Our labour productivity has been growing at around $2 \%$ per annum over the past decade from 2014 to 2024.
b. Most of this is driven by the outward-oriented sectors of our economy.
c. So we can still do better to improve productivity for our domesticoriented sectors.


Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.

# Enhancing our Technology and Innovation Engines 

37. First, we will enhance our technology and innovation engines. This is crucial because new ideas, innovation and technological progress are the drivers of growth.
38. We see this in the US, where the technology sector, powered by Silicon Valley and companies like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla, has helped to propel the country's dynamism and innovation.

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect. The higher collections were a result of Government action by injecting additional COE quota. This helped to bring prices down by 10 to $30 \%$ from the peaks in Oct 2023. But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


# D. Equipping Workers Throughout Life 

67. A growing economy creates more well-paying jobs. But the jobs of the future will not be the same as the jobs of today. Rapid technological advances, especially in Al, will transform workplaces and jobs.
68. Just a few years ago, tools like ChatGPT didn't even exist. Now there is a rapidly expanding ecosystem of Al models. They can generate high-quality text, images, and videos. 

## Mempertingkatkan Pemacu Teknologi dan Inovasi

We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
9. 

# D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans? 

53. Finally: on a third issue, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans, especially in light of our surplus position?
54. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the treatment of SINGA and how it contributed to the surplus.
a. Under SINGA, we borrow for major and long-term infrastructure projects. The spending for such projects is capitalised, which allows us to spread the expenses across the useful life of the asset.
b. This, as we have explained, is more equitable as the asset will benefit both current and future generations.

c. This accounting treatment has been in place since FY2021.


To achieve this, we must continue to uphold several fundamentals. That includes:
a. Maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies;
b. Harnessing market forces to drive efficiency and innovation;
c. Staying open to people and ideas to strengthen our capabilities;
d. And deepening our tripartite partnership as a cornerstone of economic stability.
36. At the same time, our approach and strategy must adapt to changing circumstances.
a. At this stage of development, we can no longer compete on cost alone. Instead, we must differentiate ourselves by producing high-value solutions for the world.
b. To take our economy forward, this Budget will emphasise three key areas: technology and innovation, our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our infrastructure investments amidst resource constraints."
What are the main factors contributing to the high costs of doing business in Singapore?,"Economic realities such as land scarcity and global energy price levels contribute to high costs. Additionally, labour costs reflect the wages of Singaporean workers, which must be matched by productivity gains.","# B. Tackling Cost Pressures 

19. Let me start by addressing concerns over rising costs, for both individuals and businesses.
20. Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.


## Strengthening Enterprise Ecosystem

- Extend support schemes for internationalisation, as well as mergers and acquisitions
- Up to $\$ 150$ million for new Enterprise Compute Initiative
- \$1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund
- Tax incentives to support development of Singapore's equities market
- Launch Global Founder Programme

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.

26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.

## A. Introduction

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

3. The questions raised by Members during this debate revolve around three main issues:
a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

We achieve this by living within our means, and running a balanced budget over each term of government. This means spending prudently to meet our immediate and future needs, ensuring that our revenues cover expenditures, and keeping the tax burden as low as we can, while not burdening Singaporeans with debt.

How does land scarcity in Singapore affect land prices?,Land scarcity in a small island nation like Singapore contributes to upward pressure on land prices due to its limited availability.,"11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.

12. 

38. More specifically, when you look at the HDB market - in the short term market, resale prices can be up, and they can be down. In localised popular areas, they will generally be higher than the less popular areas. That's why we introduced a new classification system with the Plus and Prime flats.
39. But overall, in the longer term, we are confident that HDB prices will remain affordable. Why? Because only Singaporeans can buy HDB flats. And we can, and we will build enough housing for every Singaporean household.
40. For now, we have focussed on ensuring that the new flats are available for first-timers, especially young married couples and parents with young children.
a. And we are seeing concrete improvements. The application rate for firsttimer families across all flat types has stabilised: in fact it has come down from 3.7 times in 2019 to 2.1 times in 2024. This is the application rate, so application rates are now below pre-COVID levels.
b. And with a sustained and robust supply of new flats, and as the overall market stabilises, we will have scope to consider how to adjust our policies to meet the needs of other groups, including second-timers and singles.
41. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

Some of you may ask, and this is the right question to ask, is this sustainable?
a. It will not be sustainable if overall property prices keep rising faster than incomes, and the financing gap keeps growing year after year.
b. But this will not happen because we keep a close watch over the property market, and we ensure it does not happen.
c. That's why we have introduced cooling measures where necessary by increasing the ABSD for multiple property and foreigner purchases. And

we have significantly increased BTO supply as well as Government Land Sales to make up for the disruption that occurred during COVID.
d. And these measures have helped and will eventually stabilise the market.


70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

110. We will employ a range of solutions to do so. These range from static structures like sea walls, to more specialised measures like barrages and tidal gates, as well as reclamation to create more land.
a. In the southeastern part of Singapore, we earlier announced plans to reclaim land to develop ""Long Island"". Besides raising the ground level above rising sea levels, this will create additional space for homes, as well as new waterfront parks for outdoor recreation.

b. In addition, PUB will complete site-specific studies for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Changi this year; studies for Jurong Island and the Northwest Coast are also underway. And step by step, we will complete the plans for coastal protection around the entire island.
111. The actual implementation of measures could stretch over two decades or longer, starting from the 2030s onwards. But it would be prudent to set aside funds now to ensure we can proceed with these major investments, which will benefit current and future generations. So I will top up the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.

Members have offered many suggestions. Ms Hazel Poa said we need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations, and that we are overly reliant on the price mechanism, citing land as an example.
35. But pricing all resources properly is not about giving more weight to economic over social considerations; it's simply about getting our policies right and doing things the right way.
a. If we don't price properly, then we are giving a hidden subsidy.
b. A subsidy means someone has to pay. If it's not paid by consumers, it's paid by taxpayers. If it's not paid today, it will have to be paid tomorrow.
c. Because at the end of the day, there is no free lunch.
36. So our approach must be to get the price right. Then we decide how much to subsidise.
a. Take public housing as an example.
b. HDB has to pay the market price for the land when it develops a new flat.
c. But when it prices the new flat for sale, it doesn't recover fully the cost of the flat; instead, it prices it on the basis of affordability as we have said time and again.

d. I give you a concrete example. A 4-room BTO flat in Sengkang. This was in the October 2024 BTO exercise.
e. After accounting for grants, a resale flat nearby in that area is around $\$ 545,000$. Five years ago, it was about \$360,000Resale prices have gone up nearly $\$ 200,000$.
f. What about the sales price by HDB for a new flat? The BTO price has not gone up by that much. Instead, it has increased in line with median income over that period, and was sold at about $\$ 370,000$.
g. So resale prices have gone up a lot. BTO, yes, but not as much, and in line with median incomes.
h. The difference is a subsidy borne by the government.
i. That, together with the higher cost of construction, that is one of the key reasons why HDB's deficit has increased sharply. If you look at its annual statements, in FY2018 the deficit was $\$ 2$ billion. Now in FY2023 it's $\$ 6.8$ billion. And the Government's funding to HDB to cover its deficit has correspondingly increased over the years, to cover the deficit.

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

30. As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.
a. That remains the key thrust of our approach.
b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.
c. Singaporean households - across different income levels - have experienced sustained real income growth over the past decade. And

what we have achieved has outperformed many other advanced economies, as you can see from this chart.

31. "
What is the relationship between wage increases and productivity gains in Singapore?,"Wage increases are closely tied to productivity gains in Singapore. The government aims to ensure that wage increases are matched by productivity growth, as stagnant wages can lead to decreased competitiveness and economic stagnation. However, recent data suggests that wage increases have been commensurate with productivity growth over the past decade, indicating a positive correlation between the two.","11.

This meant higher wages and real incomes for many, many workers.
b. It will be hard to achieve $4 \%$ growth on a sustained basis. But if we can secure an average of $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ growth per annum over the next decade, we will be able to create better jobs and opportunities, and improve standards of living for all Singaporeans.

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

# D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans? 

53. Finally: on a third issue, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans, especially in light of our surplus position?
54. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the treatment of SINGA and how it contributed to the surplus.
a. Under SINGA, we borrow for major and long-term infrastructure projects. The spending for such projects is capitalised, which allows us to spread the expenses across the useful life of the asset.
b. This, as we have explained, is more equitable as the asset will benefit both current and future generations.

c. This accounting treatment has been in place since FY2021.


## A. Introduction

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

3. The questions raised by Members during this debate revolve around three main issues:
a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect. The higher collections were a result of Government action by injecting additional COE quota. This helped to bring prices down by 10 to $30 \%$ from the peaks in Oct 2023. But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


We will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC's e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints islandwide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes, and prepare them for interviews.
94. Besides nationwide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.
a. Today, North East CDC runs Job Placement Centres for its district, in partnership with WSG. The centres have yielded meaningful outcomes.

b. We will expand localised job matching to all CDCs across the island.
95. We will also strengthen our support for two groups of workers in this Budget - seniors and ex-offenders.
96. More seniors are staying employed as our population ages. We want to work with employers to tap on the experience and wisdom of seniors who are able and wish to continue working.
a. In the immediate term, I will extend the Senior Employment

Credit (or SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $\$ 4,000$ a month.
b. In line with the increase in the re-employment age, I will raise the qualifying age for the highest SEC wage support tier to 69 years old, from 68 years old today. The Government will reimburse companies up to $7 \%$ of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.

97. Later this year, MOM will convene a Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment. The workgroup will undertake a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies, to improve the employability of seniors, and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.
98. In line with the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, we will proceed with the next step of planned CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers. We will increase the CPF contribution rates for those aged above 55 to 65 by 1.5 percentage points in 2026.
a. We will also continue to provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2026.
b. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost.


I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger."
How has real wage growth compared to productivity growth in Singapore over the past decade?,Real wage growth in Singapore has been commensurate with productivity growth over the past decade.,"30. As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.
a. That remains the key thrust of our approach.
b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.
c. Singaporean households - across different income levels - have experienced sustained real income growth over the past decade. And

what we have achieved has outperformed many other advanced economies, as you can see from this chart.

Annualised Real Household Income Growth among Advanced Economies (\% per annum), 2013-2023
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Source: DOS, MOF's estimates using available data from National Statistical Offices
Figure 2
1. Income growth rates for Finland and Japan are computed using the average household incomes of the 2nd, 5th and 8th deciles, while income growth rates for other economies are computed based on household incomes at the 20th, 50th and 80th percentiles. Data for Singapore are for resident employed households.
2. Where possible, household income growth have been adjusted to account for household size differences across income groups. Data for Singapore are based on household income per member, while data for Finland and the United Kingdom are based on income equivalised using the modified-OECD scale. Data for the United States and Japan refer to total household income.
31. 

This meant higher wages and real incomes for many, many workers.
b. It will be hard to achieve $4 \%$ growth on a sustained basis. But if we can secure an average of $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ growth per annum over the next decade, we will be able to create better jobs and opportunities, and improve standards of living for all Singaporeans.

35. 

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
9. 

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

While our revenues have increased, we have also spent more on Singaporeans. For example, we provided $\$ 3$ billion in MediSave top-ups in December last year, which will help to cushion the increase in MediShield Life premiums to fund better coverage and higher payouts.
172. We also earmarked resources for projects to boost economic competitiveness, including developing critical infrastructure like Changi Terminal 5, and for the energy transition.
173. Overall, I expect to end FY2024 with a surplus of $\$ 6.4$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.
174. For FY2025, I expect a similar fiscal position, with a surplus of $\$ 6.8$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

## Building A Fairer and More Resilient Tax System

163. In this term of government, we've made several significant changes to our tax system. These revenue moves give us the resources we need to meet our spending needs, and also make our fiscal system more progressive.
164. The GST rate increase ensures we have the revenues to look after our growing number of seniors, even with rising healthcare costs.

a. Through the Assurance Package, we have cushioned and delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households.
b. Importantly, we have designed our GST system with permanent GST vouchers. This ensures that lower-income households pay a far lower effective GST rate than higherincome households.
165. We also continue to ensure fairness and improve progressivity in our tax system. This means that those who are better off will pay more in taxes to help their fellow citizens.
166. That's why we raised Property Tax rates for all non-owneroccupied residential properties, which are mainly investment properties, as well as for higher-value owner-occupied residential properties.
a. The Property Tax rate changes coincided with a sharp increase in the Annual Values of properties, which arose because of Covid-19-related supply constraints in the property market.

b. We have therefore revised and updated the Annual Value bands of owner-occupier Property Tax rates for residential properties. And that means that more homes now fall within bands with lower tax rates.
c. To further cushion the impact, we provided Property Tax rebates. In November last year, we announced another rebate of up to 20\% for owner-occupied residential properties in 2025, capped at \$1,000.
d. Taken together, all HDB owner-occupiers and over 90\% of private residential property owner-occupiers will see lower Property Taxes this year.
167. "
What is the Progressive Wage Model and how does it benefit workers in Singapore?,"The Progressive Wage Model is a framework that ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder. It benefits workers by providing them with higher wages that are matched to productivity gains, allowing them to improve their standard of living and enjoy better working conditions. This model helps to address the issue of stagnant wages in recent years, where wage increases have lagged behind productivity growth. By implementing this model, workers can benefit from increased earnings and improved job prospects, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and progressive society.","11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.

f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

# Supporting Singaporeans 

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

But more importantly, let's look at the overall picture. We continue to have a highly progressive tax and transfer system.
a. Members are familiar with the benefits and tax ratios, which we highlight every budget. And it's worth going through them again.
b. The bottom quintile of households receives $\$ 4$ in benefits for every dollar of tax paid. Middle-income households also get more benefits than tax paid as you go through the income thresholds and levels.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
c. In fact, it's only the top quintile of income earners receives less in benefits, or 30 cents, for every dollar of tax paid. So this is what our system has achieved.
d. So these outcomes are a culmination of years of deliberate moves to enhance the progressivity of our overall taxes and transfers system.
75. There is no fiscal system in the world that can deliver perfect precision and equity. But I think we have found an approach in Singapore that works for us. It is not perfect, but we continue to make it better.

a. Here, everyone contributes to taxes. The lower and middle-income will receive more support, while the higher-income and wealthier segments of the population will contribute more. It's a fair and progressive tax and redistribution system, anchored on our values of a fair and just society.
b. And the strength of our fiscal system is internationally recognised. A recent OECD report commended Singapore on our robust fiscal system.
c. This is hard-earned credibility that we have built up over many, many decades. It is not something we should take for granted, because that same credibility can be quickly destroyed in the wrong hands.
76. And at the end of the day, something as fundamental as this, Singaporeans will decide.
77. Will they prefer a government that underestimates our needs, spends more from our hard-earned reserves, and leaves us weaker?
78. Or will they prefer a government that is steadfast, that upholds fiscal responsibility and discipline, and ensures we have enough resources for current and future generations to handle unexpected challenges?
a. Sir, the PAP's approach is clear: we take our duty as stewards of the country seriously. We remain true to our mission, and manage our finances carefully for the benefit of all Singaporeans, now and in the future.
b. We will continue to do our best to convince Singaporeans that ours is the right approach - it has served us well these last 60 years, and it will continue to keep Singapore on the right track in the years ahead.

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.

23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done.

c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

99. For ex-offenders, employment is integral to their reintegration into society. To encourage employers to give ex-offenders a second chance, we had earlier introduced the Uplifting Employment Credit, which provides a wage offset to employers hiring ex-offenders.

a. Last year, the credit supported close to 700 employers in hiring more than 1,500 ex-offenders.
b. To encourage more employers to hire ex-offenders, I will extend the Uplifting Employment Credit to end-2028.
100. Sir, Singaporeans are at the core of everything we do. We will do everything we can to develop and realise the potential of all our people, so that they, in turn, realise their aspirations and dreams for themselves and their families.

This is what economic dynamism and growth can deliver for our people. And so we will keep our economy strong and vibrant, and ensure that there are even more opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans - both now and in the future.

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


## A. Introduction

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


We will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC's e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints islandwide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes, and prepare them for interviews.
94. Besides nationwide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.

a. We will also continue to provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2026.
b. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost.


## Budget Debate Round Up Speech"
Why is there a need to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe?,"The need to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe is driven by a shift in the global economic landscape. As countries focus on strengthening their defense and security interests, there is an increasing emphasis on developing robust industrial bases to support any potential conflicts.

This renewed focus on manufacturing is also influenced by the growing importance of technological advancements and innovation. The need for a strong industrial base is seen as essential to stay competitive in the global market, particularly in regions where small and open economies like Singapore may be disadvantaged.

The major powers recognize that a strong industrial base is crucial for sustaining any war effort, and this has led to increased investment in manufacturing infrastructure and capabilities. In particular, Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage due to their historical reliance on other regions for manufacturing, and there is a growing recognition of the need to rebalance their economies towards domestic production.

The cost of rebuilding manufacturing in America and Europe will be substantial, with estimates suggesting that it could exceed $1 billion.","And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

c. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future - artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals - are highly energy-intensive.
d. To meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power.
e. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.
59. One immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region.
a. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We've started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia, and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.
b. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.

60. But beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience.
a. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power.
b. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation.
c. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.
61. One established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power.
a. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010.
b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

62. We will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area.
a. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation.
b. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs.
c. Within the Government, we will reorganise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options, and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and costeffective way.
d. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.

63. Be it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure.
a. And that's why we established the Future Energy Fund last year.
b. I will top up the Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.
c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.
65. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

# Empowering Businesses 

![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)

For a country, 60 years is a short time. But we have made great strides over this period, and there is much to be grateful for.

And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

We also have considerable strengths in several industries.
a. We are a key player in semiconductors, supplying more than $10 \%$ of chips and producing one-fifth of semiconductor equipment worldwide.
b. Just as silicon chips fuel the tech industry, DNA chips are unlocking new frontiers in life sciences. These chips enable scientists to sequence DNA, which can be used to diagnose diseases or identify patient risks. They demand high levels of precision engineering, to implant millions of DNA strands onto a glass or silicon surface. Singapore alone produces more than $80 \%$ of the world's DNA chips.
c. In fact, we are a key node for the broader life sciences sector. Eight of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies have manufacturing operations here. We are also a major producer of advanced medical devices, including cardiac implants and hearing aids.

41. Take the example of American medtech company Illumina. It is the global leader in next-generation genetic sequencing instruments and DNA chips.
a. Illumina has a strong footprint in Singapore. We serve as its Asia-Pacific headquarters, and host a key R\&D and manufacturing site here.
b. This is Illumina's genome sequencer, which is designed and manufactured in Singapore. Engineers across different disciplines worked together to design this. When Covid-19 first emerged, it was such a machine that first sequenced the virus. It did so within hours, allowing scientists around the world to start developing drugs and vaccines.
c. Illumina's presence has benefited other Singapore enterprises, like Venture Corporation and Sunningdale Tech. Their partnerships with Illumina have helped them to build new innovation capabilities and expand to new areas.

42. 

But if we were to rewind the clock, and consider our situation, imagine what our situation was at the beginning of this decade.
a. We were in the thick of battle, fighting COVID.
b. I know it feels like a bad dream and a distant memory to all of us, but those were truly tough times. In 2020 alone, we had five budgets. In 2021 we had three budgets. We sought the President's approval five times to draw from Past Reserves.
c. And this is 2020, 2021. We had no way of knowing when the pandemic would end, how the virus would mutate, how many more new waves of infection we would face, how many more restrictions we have to impose, and how much deeper a fiscal hole we would end up with.
d. But we already knew for sure that spending needs would rise over the horizon. It was coming, year after year. Healthcare spending was rising,

especially with our rapidly ageing population.
e. We looked at different ways to raise revenues including through property and income taxes. But these moves were still not enough to cover the expected increase in expenditure, which was sure to happen.
59. So what should we do to plug the funding gap?
a. That's why we had to consider the GST increase.
b. It was a difficult decision. It was a difficult choice - it's never easy to raise taxes, and certainly not a tax like the GST.
c. But governance is about making responsible choices, not just popular ones. We must ask ourselves: Do we want short-term populism or longterm stability? Do we want to kick the can down the road or take the hard but necessary decisions?
60. So once there were signs that the economy had stabilised, we decided to proceed with the GST increase.
a. But we also rolled out a comprehensive Assurance Package, which effectively delayed the GST increase for the vast majority of Singaporean households.
b. Essentially, once we decided to move, the GST rates were locked in. But with the Assurance Package, we could be more responsive to changing circumstances. And we could push back effectively the impact of the GST increase.
c. And that's exactly what we did. We had multiple rounds of enhancements to the Assurance Package - to tackle cost-of-living concerns, and to ensure that the majority of households will not feel the impact of the additional GST for at least 5 years.

d. At the same time, we have a permanent GST Voucher, which we also enhanced, and this ensures that the GST and GST Voucher scheme, combined together, will support the lower-income groups and will protect them - not just over the next five or 10 years, but on a permanent and ongoing basis.
61. So with that in place, together with the other revenue moves we made, we are in a better position now. And now, the additional GST revenues have started to come in - and it's mostly, the revenues are mostly from those who are better-off, foreigners, as well as tourists. And it will give us the resources we need to improve our healthcare infrastructure, and take better care of our seniors.
62. What would have happened if we chose to avoid the GST increase because it is unpopular? Or if we did not enjoy the unexpected upsides in corporate income tax collections, which only emerged in the last two years?
a. We would have ended FY2024 in a deficit.
b. The projected balance in FY2025 would also have been a deficit.
c. And that would have meant less funding for essential services, less support for our seniors, and fewer resources to invest in our future.
d. Basically, Singapore and Singaporeans would have ended up in a much weaker position.
63. Several Members I know criticised MOF's fiscal marksmanship.
64. Look, when I started work in MOF decades ago, one of my main tasks was to provide fiscal projections. As an economist, that was what I did. I was one of those who would run the models, and churn out the figures. So I know exactly what this work entails and how difficult it is.
a. I will not defend the figures if they are off the mark.

b. But I will speak up for our MOF officers who do this work with dedication and professionalism against any unfair criticisms.
65. Ultimately, a budget is a projection - it is based on the best available information at that point in time.
a. We have to plan ahead. 

To enhance our technology and innovation engines, we have to anchor more high-quality investments. There have been attempts internationally through BEPS 2.0 to ensure that multinational enterprises (or MNEs) pay a minimum level of taxes worldwide, or to tilt the playing field in favour of governments. But in reality, MNEs wield considerable leverage and options. And that is why governments everywhere are still spending significant amounts to attract investments.
43. We cannot afford to outbid the major economies. But we do need to set aside sufficient resources to maximise our competitive strengths. So I will top up the National Productivity Fund by \$3 billion.
44. Our R\&D efforts are critical in powering our innovation and technology engines.
a. The Government has consistently invested about 1\% of GDP annually in R\&D over the last 20 years.

b. These investments have borne fruit. For example, our biotech ecosystem would not be where it is today without Biopolis, which we built more than 20 years ago. It also served as a platform for biotech talent to gather and share knowledge - knowledge that then diffused into our education system, which uplifted a new generation of Singaporeans.
45. To sustain this momentum, we must invest to keep our R\&D infrastructure at the cutting edge.
a. For our biotech sector, we will refresh our public biosciences and medtech research infrastructure in the greater one-north area. This will provide state-of-the-art facilities, promote collaboration within our research community, and enable faster translation of research into commercial solutions.
b. In the semiconductor space, we will develop a new national semiconductor R\&D fabrication facility. This will provide industry-grade tools for researchers and industry partners to prototype and test new semiconductor innovations.
c. These developments will cost about $\$ 1$ billion.

46. We will also support companies that undertake R\&D and innovation in partnership with other stakeholders. We have a good suite of schemes today, which we will further enhance. And more details are in the Annex to the Budget."
Who is leading the review of regulatory processes to cut compliance costs?,DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review.,"We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

Overview

And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

## E. Conclusion

51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.
b. So we will introduce a new $\$ 1$ billion Private Credit Growth Fund.
c. This will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply.
53. As enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia.

54. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.
a. The Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to MOF, just in time for the Budget.
b. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets.
c. The Review Group will share more details on its measures in the coming days.

What are the Corporate Income Tax rebates mentioned in the context?,"There is a 50% Corporate Income Tax rebate for Year of Assessment 2025. Additionally, every active company that employed at least one local employee last year will receive a minimum benefit of $2,000. The total benefit per company is capped at $40,000.","# Managing Business Costs

- 50\% Corporate Income Tax Rebate for Year of Assessment 2025
- Minimum benefit of \$2,000 for active companies with at least one local employee in 2024
- Raise co-funding levels for Progressive Wage Credit Scheme in 2025 and 2026
![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)

The People's Association and the CDCs will share more details later.
b. Second, I will provide a Personal Income Tax Rebate of 60\%, for the Year of Assessment 2025. This will be capped at $\$ 200$, so that the rebate mostly benefits our middle-income workers.
c. Third, as Minister Indranee had announced earlier, we will welcome all Singapore Citizen babies born this year with an SG60 Baby Gift.

Higher prices also affect our businesses, many of whom are grappling with the higher costs of rent and labour.

28. So I will introduce a 50\% Corporate Income Tax rebate in the Year of Assessment 2025.
a. Not all companies are profitable, and some may not benefit from such a rebate. So, I will provide every active company that employed at least one local employee last year a minimum benefit of $\$ 2,000$.
b. The total benefit that each company will receive will be capped at $\$ 40,000$.
29. Despite facing higher cost pressures, I'm glad that many businesses remain committed to uplifting the wages of lower-wage workers.
a. The Government will continue to share this responsibility with employers.
b. And taking into account feedback from employers, I will enhance the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, by increasing the Government's co-funding levels for wage increases from $30 \%$ in 2025 to $40 \%$, and from $15 \%$ in 2026 to $20 \%$.

30. 

We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


# FY2024 and FY2025 Fiscal Position 

168. Let me turn to our latest fiscal position.
169. For Financial Year 2024, our revenue collections were better than expected.
170. A key reason is the upside in our Corporate Income Tax.
a. In the past, our Corporate Income Tax collections were quite stable, at about $3.2 \%$ of GDP.
b. But collections increased significantly in the last two years, and are projected to reach $4.1 \%$ of GDP in FY2024, which is quite significant.
c. This is an unexpected change. Corporate Income Tax is now the single largest contributor to total revenue - larger than even the Net Investment Returns Contribution (or NIRC).

d. There are several reasons for this higher Corporate Income Tax collection. Part of it is due to industry-specific cyclical factors, for example, in finance and wholesale trade. It could also be due to changes in the investment decisions of multinational enterprises, as they seek out stable and reliable centres like Singapore to put more of their high-end activities.

## d. Every Singaporean aged 13 to 20 this year will also receive a $\$ 500$ top-up to their Edusave account, or their Post-

Secondary Education Account. They can use this top-up to pay for their approved education-related expenses.

24. More support will be extended to individuals and families who face greater financial stress.
a. We will increase the rates for the ComCare Assistance schemes, to better support lower-income households with basic living expenses. For example, a 1-person household on Long-Term Assistance will receive an additional $\$ 120$ each month, bringing the monthly cash assistance to $\$ 760$. Those supported by Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance will also receive more than before, based on the household's composition, needs, and income.
b. In tandem, we will increase the Singapore Allowance, which is an ex-gratia payment that some of our pensioners receive. It will increase from $\$ 350$ to $\$ 390$ each month, to support those with smaller pensions. And the monthly pension ceiling will also increase to $\$ 1,320$.
c. Through the ComCare Interim Assistance scheme, we will also provide more support for community organisations as well, to help households in need.

25. 

The measures we have taken in recent years, and are taking in this Budget, will help to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
31. But in the longer term, the best way to adjust to higher prices is to grow the economy and increase productivity, so that all Singaporeans can enjoy higher real incomes and better standards of living. And let me turn to our strategies next in these areas.

## Building A Fairer and More Resilient Tax System

163. In this term of government, we've made several significant changes to our tax system. These revenue moves give us the resources we need to meet our spending needs, and also make our fiscal system more progressive.
164. The GST rate increase ensures we have the revenues to look after our growing number of seniors, even with rising healthcare costs.

a. Through the Assurance Package, we have cushioned and delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households.
b. Importantly, we have designed our GST system with permanent GST vouchers. This ensures that lower-income households pay a far lower effective GST rate than higherincome households.
165. We also continue to ensure fairness and improve progressivity in our tax system. This means that those who are better off will pay more in taxes to help their fellow citizens.
166. That's why we raised Property Tax rates for all non-owneroccupied residential properties, which are mainly investment properties, as well as for higher-value owner-occupied residential properties.
a. The Property Tax rate changes coincided with a sharp increase in the Annual Values of properties, which arose because of Covid-19-related supply constraints in the property market.

b. We have therefore revised and updated the Annual Value bands of owner-occupier Property Tax rates for residential properties. And that means that more homes now fall within bands with lower tax rates.
c. To further cushion the impact, we provided Property Tax rebates. In November last year, we announced another rebate of up to 20\% for owner-occupied residential properties in 2025, capped at \$1,000.
d. Taken together, all HDB owner-occupiers and over 90\% of private residential property owner-occupiers will see lower Property Taxes this year.

b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


## Supporting Workforce Transformation

- New SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant with up to 70\% funding support for job redesign
- Redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit with \$10,000 for eligible companies from second half of 2026 to offset out-ofpocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives
- Additional \$200 million for NTUC's Company Training Committee Grant to help more companies transform and upskill their workers

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85. 

Our tripartite partners play key roles in workforce transformation. In particular, NTUC's Company Training Committees (or CTCs) bring union leaders and employers together to design and implement workforce upgrading plans.
86. 

14. So retailers have to adapt and re-think their business models.
a. Some have done so successfully.
b. Take the example of baking supplies company Phoon Huat. It started out in 1947 as a single shop in Middle Road.
c. But with continuous transformation, it has expanded its operations significantly. It now has its own production facility, a distribution centre, and 20 retail stores in Singapore.
d. And with support from Enterprise Singapore, it has built a thriving ecommerce platform, which enables the company to export to more than

20 countries.
e. It has also adapted to changing consumer preferences, for example, by launching its own gourmet brand, refreshing its brick-and-mortar stores to provide experiential spaces for baking demonstrations and classes.
f. So this is how constant innovation and transformation can allow businesses to stay competitive and relevant.
15. It's not easy to make such transformations. But for firms that are willing to do so, the Government will provide our full support.
a. Mr Derrick Goh asked about the kind of support that's available. In fact, we have many schemes to help our SMEs.
b. In this Budget, I've highlighted three new initiatives - the SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant, the refreshed SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the Enterprise Compute Initiative.
c. These new initiatives arose out of our engagements with the Trade Associations and Chambers, the TACs, and the Singapore Business Federation. We continue to welcome their feedback and their important work in getting their members to transform their businesses.
16. At the same time, aside from the new initiatives, there are many existing initiatives for SMEs that remain part of our overall enterprise support efforts.
a. And for firms that fully utilise the support schemes, the total amount of help that they can get is, in fact, considerable.
b. In the past, the utilisation of many of our enterprise schemes has tended to be lower than what we had projected or hoped for. We've been discussing with the TACs to find out why, so that we can raise awareness amongst SMEs, and also do what we can to make the schemes more accessible. We hope the latest Budget moves will help. And if the utilisation of these schemes turns out to be higher than expected, and

more funding is required, I assure you, the Ministry of Finance will be happy to provide additional resources.
17. Besides uplifting the overall SME sector, we are also developing a pipeline of promising enterprises, some of which will eventually grow to become global companies of the future.
a. The MNEs we attract to Singapore support this enterprise development strategy. Because the smaller firms can partner with the MNEs, and eventually expand to new markets abroad. And as Mr Neil Parekh highlighted, such partnerships are beneficial, and we will continue to create more opportunities for collaboration.
b. Some enterprises are started by global entrepreneurs or founders from abroad who are keen to use Singapore as a launchpad, and we welcome more of them to come here and to launch their next big idea here.
c. There are also homegrown companies emerging from our R\&D ecosystem, which DPM Heng mentioned yesterday. And more young Singaporeans are now prepared to take the plunge into entrepreneurship.
d. So on the whole, if you look at our enterprise ecosystem today compared to 15 years ago, I would say things have improved considerably. But there's still much more we need to do, and we will press on with our efforts.

## A. Introduction

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

3. The questions raised by Members during this debate revolve around three main issues:
a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

# Ensuring No One Is Left Behind 

46. This same approach applies to other areas, which many members spoke about.
a. For example, many MPs, Mr Vikram Nair, Associate Professor Razwana Begum, Ms Hany Soh, Mr Alex Yam, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Mr Louis

Ng, and Ms Carrie Tan, amongst others, spoke about more support for families, and support not just in financial terms, but also leave arrangements, which was a popular refrain from the speeches. We will have to look at all these suggestions.
b. Others like Ms Denise Phua, Mr Don Wee, Mr Ang Wei Neng, and Mr Sharael Taha have highlighted the need for more inclusive hiring practices and employment support for Persons with Disabilities. I agree we must do more for Persons with Disabilities. And in my Budget statement, I said we are embarking on a comprehensive study to look at post-18 pathways for people with disabilities, and we will want to do more for them.
c. Many members like SPS Eric Chua, Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Xie Yao Quan, and Mr Dennis Tan also spoke about the need to help our seniors age well and ensure they are not left behind in their silver years.
d. In fact we have made significant moves over the past 1-2 years to support these groups, including at this Budget.
e. But our attitude is we are never satisfied with the status quo, and will continue to review and study how we can make things better.
47. Likewise on the subject of caregivers, which many members spoke about, including Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Sharael Taha, Ms Ng Ling Ling, Ms Joan Pereira, and Dr Tan Wu Meng.
a. Caregiving arrangements vary from family to family - some have sole caregivers, while others will share the responsibility over several family members.
b. We recognise the crucial role caregivers play and the sacrifices they make, such as leaving employment to care for family arrangements, or forgoing their careers to spend more time to take care of their family

members. We want to provide support for those who have to take up this role, as it is not easy for them.
c. It is difficult to put a monetary value on caregiving. And furthermore, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to support caregivers. So our approach has been to provide support for the family as a whole.
d. And in this Budget, we have significantly enhanced the Home Caregiving Grant, and increased subsidies for care services in nursing homes and in the community.
e. But this not the end of our moves. In fact, we will study more to see how we can further strengthen our support for caregivers.

55. Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about the assets linked to the $\$ 3$ billion money laundering case, which have been surrendered to the state. These assets are progressively being liquidated and when they are liquidated, the monies will be added to the Consolidated Fund. These funds are not earmarked for specific purposes, and will be part of our overall revenues to fund the Government's budget.
56. Several members including Mr Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, Ms Hazel Poa, and Mr Leong Mun Wai questioned the need to increase the GST, given our strong fiscal position.
57. I should remind Members that we are in this strong fiscal position precisely because the Government took the necessary steps early in this term to raise revenues.
58. 

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.
b. So we will introduce a new $\$ 1$ billion Private Credit Growth Fund.
c. This will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply.
53. As enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia.

54. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.
a. The Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to MOF, just in time for the Budget.
b. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets.
c. The Review Group will share more details on its measures in the coming days.

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

144. 

And so these are issues we will continue to fine tune in terms of means testing criteria.
b. Ms Jean See, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlighted other groups that may need more support such as freelance and agency

workers, as well as working mothers.
c. Ms Usha Chandradas earlier championed for the arts, and Mr Ong Hua Han reminded us to ensure our arts and sports scene remains inclusive.
d. And Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Rachel Ong advocated for mental health issues.
e. These are some of the key points members have raised.


# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


Take retirement as one example. Our CPF system will be 70 years old this year. In a time where many pension systems are struggling with sustainability, we continue to provide assurance for Singaporeans' retirement adequacy in a sustainable manner.
a. At its core, the CPF enables Singaporeans to save for their own retirement, with support from their employers.
b. But we don't just leave this to individuals alone.
c. Families are encouraged to help their loved ones save more. And we provide avenues for them to do so, with matching grants from the Government.

d. The Government provides risk-free interest rates, with extra interest for lower balances to boost savings.
e. We support lower-wage workers to earn more (and save more) through Workfare and Progressive Wages.
f. And for seniors who had lower incomes during their working years and so less in retirement, we have Silver Support to cover them.
g. So these improvements have been made to CPF over the years. And more recently, when we studied the data, we saw the need to do more for two groups:
i. First, ITE graduates whose wage trajectories were not rising fast enough compared to their peers in Polytechnics and Universities; and second, young seniors in their 50s and early 60s who could use more support for their retirement.
ii. And that's why we introduced the ITE Progression Award last year, which will support ITE graduates to pursue a diploma, and provide a top-up to their CPF accounts when they complete their diploma studies.
iii. And we also introduced the substantial Majulah Package for young seniors, and that included the one-time Retirement Savings Bonus and the MediSave Bonus, as well as a substantial Earn and Save Bonus.
45. Several members, in particular Mr Louis Chua and Mr Saktiandi Supaat, spoke at length about retirement adequacy.
a. I listened to them carefully, and we will consider all your views and suggestions.
b. On the recommendations of the CPF Advisory Panel, many have, in fact, already been taken up. There are now various low-cost funds included

under the CPF Investment Scheme which members can choose to invest in.
c. The question is whether there is scope for a low-cost life cycle fund, done in a more comprehensive and structured way, beyond just leaving CPF members to choose for themselves. Because these options exist, they can choose, but whether there is scope to do it in a more structured way.
d. Now, if we were to do that, the fund must be able to earn better returns than the prevailing SA rate, the Special Account rate, not the OA rate. And that is $4 \%$ on a risk-free basis, and up to $6 \%$ based on the extra interest. Actually, that's not so easy to beat on a consistent basis
e. Sure, you can opt to take more risks for higher returns. Mr Chua mentioned an 80:20 portfolio promising above 7\% returns. But I think he qualified, potential returns. If you are lucky you may get $7 \%$ or more. What happens if you are not so lucky? What happens if you retire at a time of market downturn? How do we provide assurance to Singaporeans?
f. So these are issues we will have to consider carefully. But we will certainly continue to review, fine-tune and improve the CPF system - to meet the needs of our seniors, and to prepare for a future with increased longevity and life expectancy."
What are some of the successful transformations made by retailers like Phoon Huat?,"Some of the successful transformations made by retailers like Phoon Huat include expanding its operations significantly, establishing its own production facility, setting up a distribution centre, and opening 20 retail stores in Singapore. Additionally, with support from Enterprise Singapore, it has built a thriving ecommerce platform that enables the company to export to more than 20 countries, and adapted to changing consumer preferences by launching its own gourmet brand and refreshing its brick-and-mortar stores to provide experiential spaces for baking demonstrations and classes.","14.

d. So on the whole, if you look at our enterprise ecosystem today compared to 15 years ago, I would say things have improved considerably. But there's still much more we need to do, and we will press on with our efforts.

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



# Memperkasakan Perniagaan

untuk Pertumbuhan dan Kejayaan

Members have offered many suggestions. Ms Hazel Poa said we need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations, and that we are overly reliant on the price mechanism, citing land as an example.
35. But pricing all resources properly is not about giving more weight to economic over social considerations; it's simply about getting our policies right and doing things the right way.
a. If we don't price properly, then we are giving a hidden subsidy.
b. A subsidy means someone has to pay. If it's not paid by consumers, it's paid by taxpayers. If it's not paid today, it will have to be paid tomorrow.
c. Because at the end of the day, there is no free lunch.
36. So our approach must be to get the price right. Then we decide how much to subsidise.
a. Take public housing as an example.
b. HDB has to pay the market price for the land when it develops a new flat.
c. But when it prices the new flat for sale, it doesn't recover fully the cost of the flat; instead, it prices it on the basis of affordability as we have said time and again.

d. I give you a concrete example. A 4-room BTO flat in Sengkang. This was in the October 2024 BTO exercise.
e. After accounting for grants, a resale flat nearby in that area is around $\$ 545,000$. Five years ago, it was about \$360,000Resale prices have gone up nearly $\$ 200,000$.
f. What about the sales price by HDB for a new flat? The BTO price has not gone up by that much. Instead, it has increased in line with median income over that period, and was sold at about $\$ 370,000$.
g. So resale prices have gone up a lot. BTO, yes, but not as much, and in line with median incomes.
h. The difference is a subsidy borne by the government.
i. That, together with the higher cost of construction, that is one of the key reasons why HDB's deficit has increased sharply. If you look at its annual statements, in FY2018 the deficit was $\$ 2$ billion. Now in FY2023 it's $\$ 6.8$ billion. And the Government's funding to HDB to cover its deficit has correspondingly increased over the years, to cover the deficit.
37. 

51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.
b. So we will introduce a new $\$ 1$ billion Private Credit Growth Fund.
c. This will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply.
53. As enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia.

54. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.
a. The Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to MOF, just in time for the Budget.
b. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets.
c. The Review Group will share more details on its measures in the coming days.

Consider the experiences of our pioneers. Like Mr Yau Jon Kiang, who is 75 this year and a resident in Yew Tee. In our early years of nation-building, he and his wife worked long hours in a canteen at the Tanjong Gul Camp at Tuas. They put food on the table for the SAF, as well as their own young sons at home. Times were tough, but they persevered.
184. Their never-say-die spirit lives on in the family.

185. Jon Kiang's son, Joses, forged his own path to become a naval engineer with the SAF. He endured long stints at sea to serve and defend our nation.

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence."
Why might Singapore consumers prefer purchasing items from abroad?,Because they can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price.,"13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.
27. 

b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

30. As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.
a. That remains the key thrust of our approach.
b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.
c. Singaporean households - across different income levels - have experienced sustained real income growth over the past decade. And

what we have achieved has outperformed many other advanced economies, as you can see from this chart.

What are the concerns of some retailers regarding the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link?,Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link on their businesses.,"13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.

d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.


We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.


14. So retailers have to adapt and re-think their business models.
a. Some have done so successfully.
b. Take the example of baking supplies company Phoon Huat. It started out in 1947 as a single shop in Middle Road.
c. But with continuous transformation, it has expanded its operations significantly. It now has its own production facility, a distribution centre, and 20 retail stores in Singapore.
d. And with support from Enterprise Singapore, it has built a thriving ecommerce platform, which enables the company to export to more than

20 countries.
e. It has also adapted to changing consumer preferences, for example, by launching its own gourmet brand, refreshing its brick-and-mortar stores to provide experiential spaces for baking demonstrations and classes.
f. So this is how constant innovation and transformation can allow businesses to stay competitive and relevant.
15. It's not easy to make such transformations. But for firms that are willing to do so, the Government will provide our full support.
a. Mr Derrick Goh asked about the kind of support that's available. In fact, we have many schemes to help our SMEs.
b. In this Budget, I've highlighted three new initiatives - the SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant, the refreshed SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the Enterprise Compute Initiative.
c. These new initiatives arose out of our engagements with the Trade Associations and Chambers, the TACs, and the Singapore Business Federation. We continue to welcome their feedback and their important work in getting their members to transform their businesses.
16. At the same time, aside from the new initiatives, there are many existing initiatives for SMEs that remain part of our overall enterprise support efforts.
a. And for firms that fully utilise the support schemes, the total amount of help that they can get is, in fact, considerable.
b. In the past, the utilisation of many of our enterprise schemes has tended to be lower than what we had projected or hoped for. We've been discussing with the TACs to find out why, so that we can raise awareness amongst SMEs, and also do what we can to make the schemes more accessible. We hope the latest Budget moves will help. And if the utilisation of these schemes turns out to be higher than expected, and

more funding is required, I assure you, the Ministry of Finance will be happy to provide additional resources.
17. Besides uplifting the overall SME sector, we are also developing a pipeline of promising enterprises, some of which will eventually grow to become global companies of the future.
a. The MNEs we attract to Singapore support this enterprise development strategy. Because the smaller firms can partner with the MNEs, and eventually expand to new markets abroad. And as Mr Neil Parekh highlighted, such partnerships are beneficial, and we will continue to create more opportunities for collaboration.
b. Some enterprises are started by global entrepreneurs or founders from abroad who are keen to use Singapore as a launchpad, and we welcome more of them to come here and to launch their next big idea here.
c. There are also homegrown companies emerging from our R\&D ecosystem, which DPM Heng mentioned yesterday. And more young Singaporeans are now prepared to take the plunge into entrepreneurship.
d. So on the whole, if you look at our enterprise ecosystem today compared to 15 years ago, I would say things have improved considerably. But there's still much more we need to do, and we will press on with our efforts.

38. More specifically, when you look at the HDB market - in the short term market, resale prices can be up, and they can be down. In localised popular areas, they will generally be higher than the less popular areas. That's why we introduced a new classification system with the Plus and Prime flats.
39. But overall, in the longer term, we are confident that HDB prices will remain affordable. Why? Because only Singaporeans can buy HDB flats. And we can, and we will build enough housing for every Singaporean household.
40. For now, we have focussed on ensuring that the new flats are available for first-timers, especially young married couples and parents with young children.
a. And we are seeing concrete improvements. The application rate for firsttimer families across all flat types has stabilised: in fact it has come down from 3.7 times in 2019 to 2.1 times in 2024. This is the application rate, so application rates are now below pre-COVID levels.
b. And with a sustained and robust supply of new flats, and as the overall market stabilises, we will have scope to consider how to adjust our policies to meet the needs of other groups, including second-timers and singles.
41.

Members have offered many suggestions. Ms Hazel Poa said we need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations, and that we are overly reliant on the price mechanism, citing land as an example.
35. But pricing all resources properly is not about giving more weight to economic over social considerations; it's simply about getting our policies right and doing things the right way.
a. If we don't price properly, then we are giving a hidden subsidy.
b. A subsidy means someone has to pay. If it's not paid by consumers, it's paid by taxpayers. If it's not paid today, it will have to be paid tomorrow.
c. Because at the end of the day, there is no free lunch.
36. So our approach must be to get the price right. Then we decide how much to subsidise.
a. Take public housing as an example.
b. HDB has to pay the market price for the land when it develops a new flat.
c. But when it prices the new flat for sale, it doesn't recover fully the cost of the flat; instead, it prices it on the basis of affordability as we have said time and again.

d. I give you a concrete example. A 4-room BTO flat in Sengkang. This was in the October 2024 BTO exercise.
e. After accounting for grants, a resale flat nearby in that area is around $\$ 545,000$. Five years ago, it was about \$360,000Resale prices have gone up nearly $\$ 200,000$.
f. What about the sales price by HDB for a new flat? The BTO price has not gone up by that much. Instead, it has increased in line with median income over that period, and was sold at about $\$ 370,000$.
g. So resale prices have gone up a lot. BTO, yes, but not as much, and in line with median incomes.
h. The difference is a subsidy borne by the government.
i. That, together with the higher cost of construction, that is one of the key reasons why HDB's deficit has increased sharply. If you look at its annual statements, in FY2018 the deficit was $\$ 2$ billion. Now in FY2023 it's $\$ 6.8$ billion. And the Government's funding to HDB to cover its deficit has correspondingly increased over the years, to cover the deficit.
37. 

e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now."
What is the role of the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review?,The committee reviews regulatory processes to cut compliance costs.,"We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.

c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


## Strengthening Enterprise Ecosystem

- Extend support schemes for internationalisation, as well as mergers and acquisitions
- Up to $\$ 150$ million for new Enterprise Compute Initiative
- \$1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund
- Tax incentives to support development of Singapore's equities market
- Launch Global Founder Programme

Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.

C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85. 

## A. Introduction

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

3. The questions raised by Members during this debate revolve around three main issues:
a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. "
How does the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme help companies with wage increases for lower-wage workers?,"The scheme provides co-funding levels that increase from 30% in 2025 to 40% of wage increases. This means that for every dollar of wage increase, the government will contribute a portion of it, allowing companies to share the cost with the government. The goal is to support companies in paying higher wages to their lower-wage workers while also encouraging productivity gains and skills upgrading.","We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


# Managing Business Costs 

- Benefits for companies capped at \$40,000
- 50\% Corporate Income Tax Rebate for Year of Assessment 2025
- Minimum benefit of \$2,000 for active companies with at least one local employee in 2024
- Raise co-funding levels for Progressive Wage Credit Scheme in 2025 and 2026
![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)

Let me show how companies can benefit from all of these initiatives in a concrete way. Take for example SATS, our main air cargo handler and airline caterer at Changi Airport.
a. SATS is investing in new equipment and technology to improve the efficiency of its catering services. It also needs to train its workers to handle the new equipment, and redesign workflows and jobs.
b. It can access the additional \$10,000 in SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. It can tap on the new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant to cover up to $90 \%$ of the cost for reskilling workers, and up to $70 \%$ of the cost for redesigning jobs.

89. SATS has worked with NTUC to form a CTC, and has been sending its employees for the Work-Study Diploma in Airport Operations at ITE.
a. The Work-Study Diploma helps these employees acquire critical skills, including managing operations and resource planning. And they can go on to take on supervisory roles in SATS, subject to good performance.
b. Currently, SATS fully sponsors its workers' out-of-pocket programme fees. The CTC grant will help to offset some of these training costs, and provide enhanced funding for absentee payroll when the trainee is away from work.
c. So these are tangible benefits that companies can enjoy and we encourage all companies to press on with their workforce and business transformation.


Higher prices also affect our businesses, many of whom are grappling with the higher costs of rent and labour.

28. So I will introduce a 50\% Corporate Income Tax rebate in the Year of Assessment 2025.
a. Not all companies are profitable, and some may not benefit from such a rebate. So, I will provide every active company that employed at least one local employee last year a minimum benefit of $\$ 2,000$.
b. The total benefit that each company will receive will be capped at $\$ 40,000$.
29. Despite facing higher cost pressures, I'm glad that many businesses remain committed to uplifting the wages of lower-wage workers.
a. The Government will continue to share this responsibility with employers.
b. And taking into account feedback from employers, I will enhance the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, by increasing the Government's co-funding levels for wage increases from $30 \%$ in 2025 to $40 \%$, and from $15 \%$ in 2026 to $20 \%$.

30. 

# Strengthening Support for Workers 

91. Even with reskilling and upskilling, some workers may face career setbacks due to economic and business disruptions.
92. We will help workers who lose their jobs to get back on their feet through the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, which will start from April this year. The scheme will provide financial support of up to $\$ 6,000$ over six months, to give our workers assurance as they undergo training or search for jobs.
93. 

99. For ex-offenders, employment is integral to their reintegration into society. To encourage employers to give ex-offenders a second chance, we had earlier introduced the Uplifting Employment Credit, which provides a wage offset to employers hiring ex-offenders.

a. Last year, the credit supported close to 700 employers in hiring more than 1,500 ex-offenders.
b. To encourage more employers to hire ex-offenders, I will extend the Uplifting Employment Credit to end-2028.
100. Sir, Singaporeans are at the core of everything we do. We will do everything we can to develop and realise the potential of all our people, so that they, in turn, realise their aspirations and dreams for themselves and their families.

# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85. 

## Supporting Workforce Transformation

- New SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant with up to 70\% funding support for job redesign
- Redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit with \$10,000 for eligible companies from second half of 2026 to offset out-ofpocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives
- Additional \$200 million for NTUC's Company Training Committee Grant to help more companies transform and upskill their workers

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

We will also give a further boost to our lower-wage workers, who will benefit from early upskilling.
a. Today, our lower-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Skills Support Scheme from the age of 30.
b. The scheme provides employers with absentee payroll support when they sponsor workers for training. It also provides workers with a training allowance when they go for self-sponsored training.
74. Currently, the Workfare Skills Support Scheme is designed primarily to support short courses that are completed over a few days. But lower-wage workers stand to benefit more from longerform courses that provide more substantial reskilling and upskilling.
75. We will therefore introduce an enhanced tier of support under the Workfare Skills Support for lower-wage workers. This enhanced support will be modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, and will benefit lower-wage workers when they turn 30. So this will start earlier at age 30. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the Committee of Supply (COS).

76. Our Institutes of Higher Learning are key partners in supporting lifelong learning. They equip our workers with relevant skills for a changing economy, and provide a dedicated setting for deep learning.
a. We will support the Singapore University of Social Sciences (or SUSS) in developing a new city campus. This will enable SUSS to champion lifelong learning and deliver programmes with a strong social emphasis, at an accessible location in the city for learners of all ages.
b. We will also extend the Singapore Universities Trust by 10 years to 31 March 2042 to support the fundraising efforts of our newer Autonomous Universities, namely SUSS and the Singapore Institute of Technology. The Trust provides matching grants for donations, to support our Autonomous Universities in building up their endowment funds.
77. Sir, the Government is fully committed to supporting the lifelong employability of our workers. We cannot stop the waves of technological innovations. Nor can we save every job. But we can and we will invest in every worker and every Singaporean. We will equip everyone with the skills to adapt, compete and succeed in a changing economy.

## Strengthening Employment Support

- CPF Transition Offset to cover half the increase in employer CPF contributions for senior workers aged above 55 to 65
- Extend Senior Employment Credit to 2026 to offset wages for hiring senior workers
- Extend Uplifting Employment Credit to 2028 to offset wages for hiring ex-offenders
![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)

We will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC's e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints islandwide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes, and prepare them for interviews.
94. Besides nationwide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.
a. Today, North East CDC runs Job Placement Centres for its district, in partnership with WSG. The centres have yielded meaningful outcomes.

b. We will expand localised job matching to all CDCs across the island.
95. We will also strengthen our support for two groups of workers in this Budget - seniors and ex-offenders.
96. More seniors are staying employed as our population ages. We want to work with employers to tap on the experience and wisdom of seniors who are able and wish to continue working.
a. In the immediate term, I will extend the Senior Employment

Credit (or SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $\$ 4,000$ a month.
b. In line with the increase in the re-employment age, I will raise the qualifying age for the highest SEC wage support tier to 69 years old, from 68 years old today. The Government will reimburse companies up to $7 \%$ of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.

97. Later this year, MOM will convene a Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment. The workgroup will undertake a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies, to improve the employability of seniors, and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.
98. In line with the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, we will proceed with the next step of planned CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers. We will increase the CPF contribution rates for those aged above 55 to 65 by 1.5 percentage points in 2026.
a. We will also continue to provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2026.
b. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost.
"
How is e-commerce affecting local retailers in Singapore?,"E-commerce is already having a significant impact on local retailers in Singapore, with many consumers able to purchase items from abroad at cheaper prices than their local retail counterparts. This increased competition is forcing retailers to adapt and rethink their business models, as seen in the example of Phoon Huat, which has successfully transformed its operations through continuous innovation and transformation.","13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


# Supporting Singaporeans 

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

14. So retailers have to adapt and re-think their business models.
a. Some have done so successfully.
b. Take the example of baking supplies company Phoon Huat. It started out in 1947 as a single shop in Middle Road.
c. But with continuous transformation, it has expanded its operations significantly. It now has its own production facility, a distribution centre, and 20 retail stores in Singapore.
d. And with support from Enterprise Singapore, it has built a thriving ecommerce platform, which enables the company to export to more than

20 countries.
e. It has also adapted to changing consumer preferences, for example, by launching its own gourmet brand, refreshing its brick-and-mortar stores to provide experiential spaces for baking demonstrations and classes.
f. So this is how constant innovation and transformation can allow businesses to stay competitive and relevant.
15. It's not easy to make such transformations. But for firms that are willing to do so, the Government will provide our full support.
a. Mr Derrick Goh asked about the kind of support that's available. In fact, we have many schemes to help our SMEs.
b. In this Budget, I've highlighted three new initiatives - the SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant, the refreshed SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the Enterprise Compute Initiative.
c. These new initiatives arose out of our engagements with the Trade Associations and Chambers, the TACs, and the Singapore Business Federation. We continue to welcome their feedback and their important work in getting their members to transform their businesses.
16. At the same time, aside from the new initiatives, there are many existing initiatives for SMEs that remain part of our overall enterprise support efforts.
a. And for firms that fully utilise the support schemes, the total amount of help that they can get is, in fact, considerable.
b. In the past, the utilisation of many of our enterprise schemes has tended to be lower than what we had projected or hoped for. We've been discussing with the TACs to find out why, so that we can raise awareness amongst SMEs, and also do what we can to make the schemes more accessible. We hope the latest Budget moves will help. And if the utilisation of these schemes turns out to be higher than expected, and

more funding is required, I assure you, the Ministry of Finance will be happy to provide additional resources.
17. Besides uplifting the overall SME sector, we are also developing a pipeline of promising enterprises, some of which will eventually grow to become global companies of the future.
a. The MNEs we attract to Singapore support this enterprise development strategy. Because the smaller firms can partner with the MNEs, and eventually expand to new markets abroad. And as Mr Neil Parekh highlighted, such partnerships are beneficial, and we will continue to create more opportunities for collaboration.
b. Some enterprises are started by global entrepreneurs or founders from abroad who are keen to use Singapore as a launchpad, and we welcome more of them to come here and to launch their next big idea here.
c. There are also homegrown companies emerging from our R\&D ecosystem, which DPM Heng mentioned yesterday. And more young Singaporeans are now prepared to take the plunge into entrepreneurship.
d. So on the whole, if you look at our enterprise ecosystem today compared to 15 years ago, I would say things have improved considerably. But there's still much more we need to do, and we will press on with our efforts.

Overview

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

159. Many businesses have also stepped forward to support their fellow Singaporeans in this SG60 year, and will be providing special SG60 discounts and offers. I would like to encourage more businesses to join in and offer their support.

160. Singapore is at its strongest when we stand together. We may have our differences. But we are all Singaporeans, living on this tiny red dot, as one family. When we rally together as one, there is no challenge we cannot overcome. And this unity is what keeps us resilient, thriving, and moving forward, even in an uncertain and troubled world."
What role does Enterprise Singapore play in supporting businesses like Phoon Huat?,"Enterprise Singapore plays a crucial role in supporting businesses like Phoon Huat by providing various schemes and initiatives to help them adapt and transform their business models. They offer support for companies to scale up, execute their growth plans, and compete on the global stage. Additionally, they have schemes that enable companies to send employees for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programs, which can be beneficial for businesses like Phoon Huat in terms of nurturing and grooming Singaporean leaders.","14. So retailers have to adapt and re-think their business models.
a. Some have done so successfully.

d. So on the whole, if you look at our enterprise ecosystem today compared to 15 years ago, I would say things have improved considerably. But there's still much more we need to do, and we will press on with our efforts.

51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.
b. So we will introduce a new $\$ 1$ billion Private Credit Growth Fund.
c. This will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply.
53. As enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia.

54. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.
a. The Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to MOF, just in time for the Budget.
b. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets.
c. The Review Group will share more details on its measures in the coming days.

# Strengthening our Enterprise Ecosystem 

47. Second, we will strengthen our enterprise ecosystem.
a. Over the years, we have developed a stronger pool of globally competitive startups and enterprises.
b. But there is still more to be done.
48. We want Singapore to be a place where exciting ventures develop and grow into the leading enterprises of the future.

a. We already have a good pipeline of such promising enterprises. For example, AEM Holdings is a Singaporeheadquartered provider of semiconductor testing solutions. Its products serve a critical role in the chip production process, by helping to detect manufacturing defects or design flaws. AEM today has a global footprint, with manufacturing plants and R\&D teams across Asia, Europe, and the US.
b. We will provide more support for enterprises to scale up, execute their growth plans, and compete on the global stage. 

## Strengthening Enterprise Ecosystem

- Extend support schemes for internationalisation, as well as mergers and acquisitions
- Up to $\$ 150$ million for new Enterprise Compute Initiative
- \$1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund
- Tax incentives to support development of Singapore's equities market
- Launch Global Founder Programme

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


In particular, I will extend our support schemes for internationalisation, and for mergers and acquisitions. And again, the details are in the Annex to the Budget.
c. Some ventures are started by global companies, or by experienced entrepreneurs. As our investment promotion agency, EDB has close links with these multinational firms and entrepreneurs. So EDB will launch a Global Founder Programme later this year to encourage global founders to anchor and grow more new ventures in Singapore.

49. 

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

# Supporting Singaporeans 

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85. 

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore."
What are the new initiatives highlighted in the Budget to support SMEs?,"The new initiatives highlighted in the Budget to support SMEs include the SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant, the refreshed SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit, and the Enterprise Compute Initiative.","14. So retailers have to adapt and re-think their business models.

a. Mr Derrick Goh asked about the kind of support that's available. In fact, we have many schemes to help our SMEs.
b. In this Budget, I've highlighted three new initiatives - the SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant, the refreshed SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the Enterprise Compute Initiative.
c. These new initiatives arose out of our engagements with the Trade Associations and Chambers, the TACs, and the Singapore Business Federation. We continue to welcome their feedback and their important work in getting their members to transform their businesses.
16. At the same time, aside from the new initiatives, there are many existing initiatives for SMEs that remain part of our overall enterprise support efforts.
a. And for firms that fully utilise the support schemes, the total amount of help that they can get is, in fact, considerable.
b. In the past, the utilisation of many of our enterprise schemes has tended to be lower than what we had projected or hoped for. We've been discussing with the TACs to find out why, so that we can raise awareness amongst SMEs, and also do what we can to make the schemes more accessible. We hope the latest Budget moves will help. And if the utilisation of these schemes turns out to be higher than expected, and

more funding is required, I assure you, the Ministry of Finance will be happy to provide additional resources.
17. Besides uplifting the overall SME sector, we are also developing a pipeline of promising enterprises, some of which will eventually grow to become global companies of the future.
a. The MNEs we attract to Singapore support this enterprise development strategy. Because the smaller firms can partner with the MNEs, and eventually expand to new markets abroad. And as Mr Neil Parekh highlighted, such partnerships are beneficial, and we will continue to create more opportunities for collaboration.
b. Some enterprises are started by global entrepreneurs or founders from abroad who are keen to use Singapore as a launchpad, and we welcome more of them to come here and to launch their next big idea here.
c. There are also homegrown companies emerging from our R\&D ecosystem, which DPM Heng mentioned yesterday. And more young Singaporeans are now prepared to take the plunge into entrepreneurship.
d. So on the whole, if you look at our enterprise ecosystem today compared to 15 years ago, I would say things have improved considerably. But there's still much more we need to do, and we will press on with our efforts.

## Strengthening Enterprise Ecosystem

- Extend support schemes for internationalisation, as well as mergers and acquisitions
- Up to $\$ 150$ million for new Enterprise Compute Initiative
- \$1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund
- Tax incentives to support development of Singapore's equities market
- Launch Global Founder Programme

To succeed, all enterprises must invest in technology to enhance their competitiveness and productivity. Enterprises can adopt off-the-shelf solutions like Al-powered analytics and digital marketing tools. We will continue to encourage the adoption of such solutions through initiatives like the Productivity Solutions Grant and the SMEs Go Digital.
50. Beyond a certain stage, enterprises will need Al solutions, which are tailored to their needs and integrated into their business processes and systems. To support this, I will set aside up to $\$ 150$ million for a new Enterprise Compute Initiative. Under this initiative, eligible enterprises will be partnered with major cloud service providers to access Al tools and computing power, as well as expert consultancy services. This will help enterprises leverage Al more effectively in their transformation journey.



## A. Introduction

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

3. The questions raised by Members during this debate revolve around three main issues:
a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

## தொழில்நிறுவனச் சூழலை வலுப்படுத்துதல்

- அனைத்துலகமயமாதல், இணைப்புகள், பற்றுமானங்கள் ஆகியவற்றுக்கான ஆதரவுத் திட்டங்களை நீட்டித்தல்
- புதிய தொழில்நிறுவனக் கணினியல் முனைப்புக்கு (\$150 மில்லியன் வரை)
- \$1 பில்லியன் தனியார் கடன் நிதி
- சிங்கப்பூர் முதலீட்டுச் சந்தையின் வளர்ச்சியை ஆதரிக்க வரி ஆதாயங்கள்
- உலகளாவிய நிறுவனர் திட்டம் துவக்கம்

We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


Sir, we are taking concrete steps to strengthen our social support system. In this Budget, l've focused on families, seniors and their long-term care needs, and persons with disabilities. But we will continue to review and update other policy areas over time. This is the Government's key priority. Because we want to build a Singapore where we have each other's backs, where no one is left behind, and where we continue to stay strong and united as one people.

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

To achieve this, we must continue to uphold several fundamentals. That includes:
a. Maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies;
b. Harnessing market forces to drive efficiency and innovation;
c. Staying open to people and ideas to strengthen our capabilities;
d. And deepening our tripartite partnership as a cornerstone of economic stability.
36. At the same time, our approach and strategy must adapt to changing circumstances.
a. At this stage of development, we can no longer compete on cost alone. Instead, we must differentiate ourselves by producing high-value solutions for the world.
b. To take our economy forward, this Budget will emphasise three key areas: technology and innovation, our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our infrastructure investments amidst resource constraints.

## Mengukuhkan Ekosistem Perusahaan

- Melanjutkan skim-skim bantuan bagi penyejagatan, serta penggabungan dan pemerolehan
- Hingga \$150 juta untuk Inisiatif Pengkomputeran Perusahaan baharu
- Dana Pertumbuhan Kredit Swasta sebanyak \$1 bilion
- Insentif-insentif cukai bagi menyokong pembangunan pasaran ekuiti Singapura

How do MNEs support the enterprise development strategy in Singapore?,"MNEs (Multinational Enterprises) support the enterprise development strategy in Singapore by partnering with smaller firms, enabling them to expand into new markets abroad. This partnership allows the smaller firms to leverage the global resources and expertise of the MNEs, ultimately contributing to the growth and development of promising enterprises in Singapore.","90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

# Strengthening our Enterprise Ecosystem 

47. Second, we will strengthen our enterprise ecosystem.
a. Over the years, we have developed a stronger pool of globally competitive startups and enterprises.
b. But there is still more to be done.
48. We want Singapore to be a place where exciting ventures develop and grow into the leading enterprises of the future.

a. We already have a good pipeline of such promising enterprises. For example, AEM Holdings is a Singaporeheadquartered provider of semiconductor testing solutions. Its products serve a critical role in the chip production process, by helping to detect manufacturing defects or design flaws. AEM today has a global footprint, with manufacturing plants and R\&D teams across Asia, Europe, and the US.
b. We will provide more support for enterprises to scale up, execute their growth plans, and compete on the global stage. 

In particular, I will extend our support schemes for internationalisation, and for mergers and acquisitions. And again, the details are in the Annex to the Budget.
c. Some ventures are started by global companies, or by experienced entrepreneurs. As our investment promotion agency, EDB has close links with these multinational firms and entrepreneurs. So EDB will launch a Global Founder Programme later this year to encourage global founders to anchor and grow more new ventures in Singapore.

49. 

## Strengthening Enterprise Ecosystem

- Extend support schemes for internationalisation, as well as mergers and acquisitions
- Up to $\$ 150$ million for new Enterprise Compute Initiative
- \$1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund
- Tax incentives to support development of Singapore's equities market
- Launch Global Founder Programme

14. So retailers have to adapt and re-think their business models.
a. Some have done so successfully.
b. Take the example of baking supplies company Phoon Huat. It started out in 1947 as a single shop in Middle Road.
c. But with continuous transformation, it has expanded its operations significantly. It now has its own production facility, a distribution centre, and 20 retail stores in Singapore.
d. And with support from Enterprise Singapore, it has built a thriving ecommerce platform, which enables the company to export to more than

20 countries.
e. It has also adapted to changing consumer preferences, for example, by launching its own gourmet brand, refreshing its brick-and-mortar stores to provide experiential spaces for baking demonstrations and classes.
f. So this is how constant innovation and transformation can allow businesses to stay competitive and relevant.
15. It's not easy to make such transformations. But for firms that are willing to do so, the Government will provide our full support.
a. Mr Derrick Goh asked about the kind of support that's available. In fact, we have many schemes to help our SMEs.

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.

51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.
b. So we will introduce a new $\$ 1$ billion Private Credit Growth Fund.
c. This will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply.
53. As enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia.

54. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.
a. The Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to MOF, just in time for the Budget.
b. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets.
c. The Review Group will share more details on its measures in the coming days.

To enhance our technology and innovation engines, we have to anchor more high-quality investments. There have been attempts internationally through BEPS 2.0 to ensure that multinational enterprises (or MNEs) pay a minimum level of taxes worldwide, or to tilt the playing field in favour of governments. But in reality, MNEs wield considerable leverage and options. And that is why governments everywhere are still spending significant amounts to attract investments.
43. We cannot afford to outbid the major economies. But we do need to set aside sufficient resources to maximise our competitive strengths. So I will top up the National Productivity Fund by \$3 billion.
44. Our R\&D efforts are critical in powering our innovation and technology engines.
a. The Government has consistently invested about 1\% of GDP annually in R\&D over the last 20 years.

b. These investments have borne fruit. For example, our biotech ecosystem would not be where it is today without Biopolis, which we built more than 20 years ago. It also served as a platform for biotech talent to gather and share knowledge - knowledge that then diffused into our education system, which uplifted a new generation of Singaporeans.
45. To sustain this momentum, we must invest to keep our R\&D infrastructure at the cutting edge.
a. For our biotech sector, we will refresh our public biosciences and medtech research infrastructure in the greater one-north area. This will provide state-of-the-art facilities, promote collaboration within our research community, and enable faster translation of research into commercial solutions.
b. In the semiconductor space, we will develop a new national semiconductor R\&D fabrication facility. This will provide industry-grade tools for researchers and industry partners to prototype and test new semiconductor innovations.
c. These developments will cost about $\$ 1$ billion.

46. We will also support companies that undertake R\&D and innovation in partnership with other stakeholders. We have a good suite of schemes today, which we will further enhance. And more details are in the Annex to the Budget."
What opportunities exist for global entrepreneurs in Singapore's enterprise ecosystem?,"Global entrepreneurs can anchor and grow new ventures in Singapore through a new initiative launched by EDB. This programme aims to encourage global founders to establish themselves in Singapore, providing them with the necessary support to thrive and contribute to the growth of the local startup scene.","# Strengthening our Enterprise Ecosystem 

47. Second, we will strengthen our enterprise ecosystem.
a. Over the years, we have developed a stronger pool of globally competitive startups and enterprises.
b. But there is still more to be done.
48. We want Singapore to be a place where exciting ventures develop and grow into the leading enterprises of the future.

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.

The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

We don't operate at the same scale as the US. But we can still excel in specific areas of innovation and technology.
a. We have a new generation of local tech companies like Grab, Sea and Razer, which have established themselves as regional or industry leaders.
b. We are home to the world's top tech companies. They already have substantial activities here, and are keen to do more out of Singapore, including in new frontier areas like artificial intelligence (or AI) and quantum computing.

40. 

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

This is what economic dynamism and growth can deliver for our people. And so we will keep our economy strong and vibrant, and ensure that there are even more opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans - both now and in the future.

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

# Tackling Infrastructure and Resource Constraints 

55. Third, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in worldclass infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints.
56. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods, and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.
a. Development on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.
b. We have achieved islandwide 5G coverage, and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.



We also have considerable strengths in several industries.
a. We are a key player in semiconductors, supplying more than $10 \%$ of chips and producing one-fifth of semiconductor equipment worldwide.
b. Just as silicon chips fuel the tech industry, DNA chips are unlocking new frontiers in life sciences. These chips enable scientists to sequence DNA, which can be used to diagnose diseases or identify patient risks. They demand high levels of precision engineering, to implant millions of DNA strands onto a glass or silicon surface. Singapore alone produces more than $80 \%$ of the world's DNA chips.
c. In fact, we are a key node for the broader life sciences sector. Eight of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies have manufacturing operations here. We are also a major producer of advanced medical devices, including cardiac implants and hearing aids.

41. Take the example of American medtech company Illumina. It is the global leader in next-generation genetic sequencing instruments and DNA chips.
a. Illumina has a strong footprint in Singapore. We serve as its Asia-Pacific headquarters, and host a key R\&D and manufacturing site here.
b. This is Illumina's genome sequencer, which is designed and manufactured in Singapore. Engineers across different disciplines worked together to design this. When Covid-19 first emerged, it was such a machine that first sequenced the virus. It did so within hours, allowing scientists around the world to start developing drugs and vaccines.
c. Illumina's presence has benefited other Singapore enterprises, like Venture Corporation and Sunningdale Tech. Their partnerships with Illumina have helped them to build new innovation capabilities and expand to new areas.

42. "
What are the potential impacts of industry transformation on job design and creation?,"Industry transformation will lead to more churn in workplaces, resulting in existing jobs being re-designed and new jobs being created. This transformation can contribute to anxiety among workers due to rapid technological advances. As a result, there is a need for support to help companies adapt and transform their workforce.","# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.


## Supporting Workforce Transformation

- New SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant with up to 70\% funding support for job redesign
- Redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit with \$10,000 for eligible companies from second half of 2026 to offset out-ofpocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives
- Additional \$200 million for NTUC's Company Training Committee Grant to help more companies transform and upskill their workers

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

# D. Equipping Workers Throughout Life 

67. A growing economy creates more well-paying jobs. But the jobs of the future will not be the same as the jobs of today. Rapid technological advances, especially in Al, will transform workplaces and jobs.
68. Just a few years ago, tools like ChatGPT didn't even exist. Now there is a rapidly expanding ecosystem of Al models. They can generate high-quality text, images, and videos. 

They can write better programming code than many experts, assist in complex problemsolving, and even help to accelerate research breakthroughs.
69. Al will get better in the future, and other new disruptive technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant. That's why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning, and have made significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our social compact.

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.

e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85.

How has the enterprise ecosystem in Singapore improved over the past 15 years?,Things have improved considerably.,"# Strengthening our Enterprise Ecosystem 

47. Second, we will strengthen our enterprise ecosystem.
a. Over the years, we have developed a stronger pool of globally competitive startups and enterprises.
b. But there is still more to be done.
48. We want Singapore to be a place where exciting ventures develop and grow into the leading enterprises of the future.

a. We already have a good pipeline of such promising enterprises. For example, AEM Holdings is a Singaporeheadquartered provider of semiconductor testing solutions. Its products serve a critical role in the chip production process, by helping to detect manufacturing defects or design flaws. AEM today has a global footprint, with manufacturing plants and R\&D teams across Asia, Europe, and the US.
b. We will provide more support for enterprises to scale up, execute their growth plans, and compete on the global stage. 

## Strengthening Enterprise Ecosystem

- Extend support schemes for internationalisation, as well as mergers and acquisitions
- Up to $\$ 150$ million for new Enterprise Compute Initiative
- \$1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund
- Tax incentives to support development of Singapore's equities market
- Launch Global Founder Programme

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.
b. So we will introduce a new $\$ 1$ billion Private Credit Growth Fund.
c. This will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply.
53. As enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia.

54. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.
a. The Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to MOF, just in time for the Budget.
b. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets.
c. The Review Group will share more details on its measures in the coming days.

14. So retailers have to adapt and re-think their business models.
a. Some have done so successfully.
b. Take the example of baking supplies company Phoon Huat. It started out in 1947 as a single shop in Middle Road.
c. But with continuous transformation, it has expanded its operations significantly. It now has its own production facility, a distribution centre, and 20 retail stores in Singapore.
d. And with support from Enterprise Singapore, it has built a thriving ecommerce platform, which enables the company to export to more than

20 countries.
e. It has also adapted to changing consumer preferences, for example, by launching its own gourmet brand, refreshing its brick-and-mortar stores to provide experiential spaces for baking demonstrations and classes.
f. So this is how constant innovation and transformation can allow businesses to stay competitive and relevant.
15. It's not easy to make such transformations. But for firms that are willing to do so, the Government will provide our full support.
a. Mr Derrick Goh asked about the kind of support that's available. In fact, we have many schemes to help our SMEs.
b. In this Budget, I've highlighted three new initiatives - the SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant, the refreshed SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the Enterprise Compute Initiative.
c. These new initiatives arose out of our engagements with the Trade Associations and Chambers, the TACs, and the Singapore Business Federation. We continue to welcome their feedback and their important work in getting their members to transform their businesses.
16. At the same time, aside from the new initiatives, there are many existing initiatives for SMEs that remain part of our overall enterprise support efforts.
a. And for firms that fully utilise the support schemes, the total amount of help that they can get is, in fact, considerable.
b. In the past, the utilisation of many of our enterprise schemes has tended to be lower than what we had projected or hoped for. We've been discussing with the TACs to find out why, so that we can raise awareness amongst SMEs, and also do what we can to make the schemes more accessible. We hope the latest Budget moves will help. And if the utilisation of these schemes turns out to be higher than expected, and

more funding is required, I assure you, the Ministry of Finance will be happy to provide additional resources.
17. Besides uplifting the overall SME sector, we are also developing a pipeline of promising enterprises, some of which will eventually grow to become global companies of the future.
a. The MNEs we attract to Singapore support this enterprise development strategy. Because the smaller firms can partner with the MNEs, and eventually expand to new markets abroad. And as Mr Neil Parekh highlighted, such partnerships are beneficial, and we will continue to create more opportunities for collaboration.
b. Some enterprises are started by global entrepreneurs or founders from abroad who are keen to use Singapore as a launchpad, and we welcome more of them to come here and to launch their next big idea here.
c. There are also homegrown companies emerging from our R\&D ecosystem, which DPM Heng mentioned yesterday. And more young Singaporeans are now prepared to take the plunge into entrepreneurship.
d. So on the whole, if you look at our enterprise ecosystem today compared to 15 years ago, I would say things have improved considerably. But there's still much more we need to do, and we will press on with our efforts.

## Mengukuhkan Ekosistem Perusahaan

- Melanjutkan skim-skim bantuan bagi penyejagatan, serta penggabungan dan pemerolehan
- Hingga \$150 juta untuk Inisiatif Pengkomputeran Perusahaan baharu
- Dana Pertumbuhan Kredit Swasta sebanyak \$1 bilion
- Insentif-insentif cukai bagi menyokong pembangunan pasaran ekuiti Singapura
- Pelancaran Program Pengasas Global

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


But despite the uncertainties, we can look ahead with a degree of confidence. Singapore today is far stronger than we were 60 years ago.
a. We have developed a strong and well-diversified economy, supported by a highly skilled workforce.
b. We have built up a robust SAF and a strong diplomatic network, to uphold our sovereignty and security.
c. We have forged a common Singaporean identity, grounded in our shared values and experiences, and our commitment to one another and our nation.
14. This is the legacy of generations of Singaporeans, with each one running a good race. The baton has now been passed, and it is our turn to take Singapore forward. This Budget builds on previous Budgets, not only to address today's challenges, but to plan ahead and secure Singapore's future.
15. Budget 2025 is a Budget for all Singaporeans.

16. It's also a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans. It further advances our Forward Singapore agenda, which incorporates your aspirations and views, and seeks to keep our society strong and united.
17. In this Budget, we will work with you to:
a. Tackle cost pressures;
b. Advance our growth frontier;
c. Equip workers throughout life;
d. Build a sustainable city;
e. Nurture a caring and inclusive society; and
f. Rally as one united people.
18. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

# Tackling Infrastructure and Resource Constraints 

55. Third, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in worldclass infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints.
56. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods, and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.
a. Development on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.
b. We have achieved islandwide 5G coverage, and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.

"
Why are Singaporeans concerned about job churn and redesign?,"Singaporeans are concerned about job churn and redesign due to the rapid pace of industry transformation, which is leading to anxiety and uncertainty about their employment prospects.","# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.


13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.


e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.
27. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger."
What disruptions could rapid technological advances pose to the job market?,"Rapid technological advances could lead to significant changes in the job market, including the creation of new jobs and the re-designing of existing ones. This is due to the transformative impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (Al) on workplaces and industries. As Al models become increasingly sophisticated, they can generate high-quality text, images, and videos, write better programming code than many experts, assist in complex problem-solving, and even help accelerate research breakthroughs.","# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.


# D. Equipping Workers Throughout Life 

67. A growing economy creates more well-paying jobs. But the jobs of the future will not be the same as the jobs of today. Rapid technological advances, especially in Al, will transform workplaces and jobs.
68. Just a few years ago, tools like ChatGPT didn't even exist. Now there is a rapidly expanding ecosystem of Al models. They can generate high-quality text, images, and videos. 

They can write better programming code than many experts, assist in complex problemsolving, and even help to accelerate research breakthroughs.
69. Al will get better in the future, and other new disruptive technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant. That's why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning, and have made significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our social compact.

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



All this has given us good momentum for our next phase.

10. But we expect greater global uncertainty and downside risks.
a. The US and China are locked in a fierce contest for global supremacy.
b. Neither side wants to come to blows. But both know that economic heft and technological prowess are key to winning this global race.
c. And both are prepared to take more assertive actions to advance their own interests, even at the expense of established international norms.
d. So we can expect escalating attempts at containment and counter-containment, with ripple effects that will inevitably draw in other countries, including Singapore.
11. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.
12. For 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook. Growth is projected at $1 \%$ to $3 \%$, while inflation is expected to average $1.5 \%$ to $2.5 \%$.

13. 

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

c. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future - artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals - are highly energy-intensive.
d. To meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power.
e. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.
59. One immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region.
a. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We've started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia, and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.
b. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.

60. But beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience.
a. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power.
b. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation.
c. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.
61. One established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power.
a. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010.
b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

62. We will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area.
a. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation.
b. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs.
c. Within the Government, we will reorganise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options, and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and costeffective way.
d. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.

63. Be it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure.
a. And that's why we established the Future Energy Fund last year.
b. I will top up the Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.
c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.
65. 

And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

To achieve this, we must continue to uphold several fundamentals. That includes:
a. Maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies;
b. Harnessing market forces to drive efficiency and innovation;
c. Staying open to people and ideas to strengthen our capabilities;
d. And deepening our tripartite partnership as a cornerstone of economic stability.
36. At the same time, our approach and strategy must adapt to changing circumstances.
a. At this stage of development, we can no longer compete on cost alone. Instead, we must differentiate ourselves by producing high-value solutions for the world.
b. To take our economy forward, this Budget will emphasise three key areas: technology and innovation, our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our infrastructure investments amidst resource constraints.

# Enhancing our Technology and Innovation Engines 

37. First, we will enhance our technology and innovation engines. This is crucial because new ideas, innovation and technological progress are the drivers of growth.
38. We see this in the US, where the technology sector, powered by Silicon Valley and companies like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla, has helped to propel the country's dynamism and innovation.
39. 

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now."
How has Phoon Huat expanded its operations since its inception?,"The company has expanded its operations significantly since its inception. It has established its own production facility, a distribution centre, and retail stores in Singapore. Additionally, with support from Enterprise Singapore, it has built an ecommerce platform that enables the company to export to more than 20 countries.","14. So retailers have to adapt and re-think their business models.
a. Some have done so successfully.
b. Take the example of baking supplies company Phoon Huat. It started out in 1947 as a single shop in Middle Road.
c. But with continuous transformation, it has expanded its operations significantly. It now has its own production facility, a distribution centre, and 20 retail stores in Singapore.
d. And with support from Enterprise Singapore, it has built a thriving ecommerce platform, which enables the company to export to more than

20 countries.
e. It has also adapted to changing consumer preferences, for example, by launching its own gourmet brand, refreshing its brick-and-mortar stores to provide experiential spaces for baking demonstrations and classes.
f. So this is how constant innovation and transformation can allow businesses to stay competitive and relevant.
15. It's not easy to make such transformations. But for firms that are willing to do so, the Government will provide our full support.
a. Mr Derrick Goh asked about the kind of support that's available. In fact, we have many schemes to help our SMEs.
b. In this Budget, I've highlighted three new initiatives - the SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant, the refreshed SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the Enterprise Compute Initiative.
c. These new initiatives arose out of our engagements with the Trade Associations and Chambers, the TACs, and the Singapore Business Federation. We continue to welcome their feedback and their important work in getting their members to transform their businesses.
16. At the same time, aside from the new initiatives, there are many existing initiatives for SMEs that remain part of our overall enterprise support efforts.
a. And for firms that fully utilise the support schemes, the total amount of help that they can get is, in fact, considerable.
b. In the past, the utilisation of many of our enterprise schemes has tended to be lower than what we had projected or hoped for. We've been discussing with the TACs to find out why, so that we can raise awareness amongst SMEs, and also do what we can to make the schemes more accessible. We hope the latest Budget moves will help. And if the utilisation of these schemes turns out to be higher than expected, and

more funding is required, I assure you, the Ministry of Finance will be happy to provide additional resources.
17. Besides uplifting the overall SME sector, we are also developing a pipeline of promising enterprises, some of which will eventually grow to become global companies of the future.
a. The MNEs we attract to Singapore support this enterprise development strategy. Because the smaller firms can partner with the MNEs, and eventually expand to new markets abroad. And as Mr Neil Parekh highlighted, such partnerships are beneficial, and we will continue to create more opportunities for collaboration.
b. Some enterprises are started by global entrepreneurs or founders from abroad who are keen to use Singapore as a launchpad, and we welcome more of them to come here and to launch their next big idea here.
c. There are also homegrown companies emerging from our R\&D ecosystem, which DPM Heng mentioned yesterday. And more young Singaporeans are now prepared to take the plunge into entrepreneurship.
d. So on the whole, if you look at our enterprise ecosystem today compared to 15 years ago, I would say things have improved considerably. But there's still much more we need to do, and we will press on with our efforts.

51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.
b. So we will introduce a new $\$ 1$ billion Private Credit Growth Fund.
c. This will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply.
53. As enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia.

54. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.
a. The Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to MOF, just in time for the Budget.
b. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets.
c. The Review Group will share more details on its measures in the coming days.

Consider the experiences of our pioneers. Like Mr Yau Jon Kiang, who is 75 this year and a resident in Yew Tee. In our early years of nation-building, he and his wife worked long hours in a canteen at the Tanjong Gul Camp at Tuas. They put food on the table for the SAF, as well as their own young sons at home. Times were tough, but they persevered.
184. Their never-say-die spirit lives on in the family.

185. Jon Kiang's son, Joses, forged his own path to become a naval engineer with the SAF. He endured long stints at sea to serve and defend our nation.

# D. Equipping Workers Throughout Life 

67. A growing economy creates more well-paying jobs. But the jobs of the future will not be the same as the jobs of today. Rapid technological advances, especially in Al, will transform workplaces and jobs.
68. Just a few years ago, tools like ChatGPT didn't even exist. Now there is a rapidly expanding ecosystem of Al models. They can generate high-quality text, images, and videos. 

We will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC's e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints islandwide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes, and prepare them for interviews.
94. Besides nationwide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.
a. Today, North East CDC runs Job Placement Centres for its district, in partnership with WSG. The centres have yielded meaningful outcomes.

b. We will expand localised job matching to all CDCs across the island.
95. We will also strengthen our support for two groups of workers in this Budget - seniors and ex-offenders.
96. More seniors are staying employed as our population ages. We want to work with employers to tap on the experience and wisdom of seniors who are able and wish to continue working.
a. In the immediate term, I will extend the Senior Employment

Credit (or SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $\$ 4,000$ a month.
b. In line with the increase in the re-employment age, I will raise the qualifying age for the highest SEC wage support tier to 69 years old, from 68 years old today. The Government will reimburse companies up to $7 \%$ of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.

97. Later this year, MOM will convene a Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment. The workgroup will undertake a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies, to improve the employability of seniors, and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.
98. In line with the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, we will proceed with the next step of planned CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers. We will increase the CPF contribution rates for those aged above 55 to 65 by 1.5 percentage points in 2026.
a. We will also continue to provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2026.
b. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost.


Besides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints, and enhance our economic resilience.
a. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water.
b. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry.

c. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future - artificial intelligence, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals - are highly energy-intensive.
d. To meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power.
e. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.
59. One immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region.
a. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We've started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia, and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.
b. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.

60. But beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience.
a. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power.
b. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation.
c. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.
61. One established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power.
a. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010.
b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

62. We will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area.
a. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation.
b. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs.
c. Within the Government, we will reorganise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options, and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and costeffective way.
d. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.

63. Be it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure.
a. And that's why we established the Future Energy Fund last year.
b. I will top up the Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.
c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.
65. 

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

144. 

Members have offered many suggestions. Ms Hazel Poa said we need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations, and that we are overly reliant on the price mechanism, citing land as an example.
35. But pricing all resources properly is not about giving more weight to economic over social considerations; it's simply about getting our policies right and doing things the right way.
a. If we don't price properly, then we are giving a hidden subsidy.
b. A subsidy means someone has to pay. If it's not paid by consumers, it's paid by taxpayers. If it's not paid today, it will have to be paid tomorrow.
c. Because at the end of the day, there is no free lunch.
36. So our approach must be to get the price right. Then we decide how much to subsidise.
a. Take public housing as an example.
b. HDB has to pay the market price for the land when it develops a new flat.
c. But when it prices the new flat for sale, it doesn't recover fully the cost of the flat; instead, it prices it on the basis of affordability as we have said time and again.

d. I give you a concrete example. A 4-room BTO flat in Sengkang. This was in the October 2024 BTO exercise.
e. After accounting for grants, a resale flat nearby in that area is around $\$ 545,000$. Five years ago, it was about \$360,000Resale prices have gone up nearly $\$ 200,000$.
f. What about the sales price by HDB for a new flat? The BTO price has not gone up by that much. Instead, it has increased in line with median income over that period, and was sold at about $\$ 370,000$.
g. So resale prices have gone up a lot. BTO, yes, but not as much, and in line with median incomes.
h. The difference is a subsidy borne by the government.
i. That, together with the higher cost of construction, that is one of the key reasons why HDB's deficit has increased sharply. If you look at its annual statements, in FY2018 the deficit was $\$ 2$ billion. Now in FY2023 it's $\$ 6.8$ billion. And the Government's funding to HDB to cover its deficit has correspondingly increased over the years, to cover the deficit.

Why has the utilisation of enterprise schemes been lower than expected in the past?,"The utilisation of enterprise schemes has been lower than expected due to a lack of awareness among SMEs about their benefits. Efforts are being made to improve accessibility, but further discussion is needed with Trade Associations and Chambers to fully understand the challenges faced by SMEs in adopting these initiatives.","# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85. 

14. So retailers have to adapt and re-think their business models.
a. Some have done so successfully.
b. Take the example of baking supplies company Phoon Huat. It started out in 1947 as a single shop in Middle Road.
c. But with continuous transformation, it has expanded its operations significantly. It now has its own production facility, a distribution centre, and 20 retail stores in Singapore.
d. And with support from Enterprise Singapore, it has built a thriving ecommerce platform, which enables the company to export to more than

20 countries.
e. It has also adapted to changing consumer preferences, for example, by launching its own gourmet brand, refreshing its brick-and-mortar stores to provide experiential spaces for baking demonstrations and classes.
f. So this is how constant innovation and transformation can allow businesses to stay competitive and relevant.
15. It's not easy to make such transformations. But for firms that are willing to do so, the Government will provide our full support.
a. Mr Derrick Goh asked about the kind of support that's available. In fact, we have many schemes to help our SMEs.
b. In this Budget, I've highlighted three new initiatives - the SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant, the refreshed SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit and the Enterprise Compute Initiative.
c. These new initiatives arose out of our engagements with the Trade Associations and Chambers, the TACs, and the Singapore Business Federation. We continue to welcome their feedback and their important work in getting their members to transform their businesses.
16. At the same time, aside from the new initiatives, there are many existing initiatives for SMEs that remain part of our overall enterprise support efforts.

d. So on the whole, if you look at our enterprise ecosystem today compared to 15 years ago, I would say things have improved considerably. But there's still much more we need to do, and we will press on with our efforts.

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

## Strengthening Enterprise Ecosystem

- Extend support schemes for internationalisation, as well as mergers and acquisitions
- Up to $\$ 150$ million for new Enterprise Compute Initiative
- \$1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund
- Tax incentives to support development of Singapore's equities market
- Launch Global Founder Programme

# D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans? 

53. Finally: on a third issue, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans, especially in light of our surplus position?
54. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the treatment of SINGA and how it contributed to the surplus.
a. Under SINGA, we borrow for major and long-term infrastructure projects. The spending for such projects is capitalised, which allows us to spread the expenses across the useful life of the asset.
b. This, as we have explained, is more equitable as the asset will benefit both current and future generations.

c. This accounting treatment has been in place since FY2021.


# Managing Business Costs 

- Benefits for companies capped at \$40,000
- 50\% Corporate Income Tax Rebate for Year of Assessment 2025
- Minimum benefit of \$2,000 for active companies with at least one local employee in 2024
- Raise co-funding levels for Progressive Wage Credit Scheme in 2025 and 2026
![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)

Let me show how companies can benefit from all of these initiatives in a concrete way. Take for example SATS, our main air cargo handler and airline caterer at Changi Airport.
a. SATS is investing in new equipment and technology to improve the efficiency of its catering services. It also needs to train its workers to handle the new equipment, and redesign workflows and jobs.
b. It can access the additional \$10,000 in SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. It can tap on the new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant to cover up to $90 \%$ of the cost for reskilling workers, and up to $70 \%$ of the cost for redesigning jobs.

89. SATS has worked with NTUC to form a CTC, and has been sending its employees for the Work-Study Diploma in Airport Operations at ITE.
a. The Work-Study Diploma helps these employees acquire critical skills, including managing operations and resource planning. And they can go on to take on supervisory roles in SATS, subject to good performance.
b. Currently, SATS fully sponsors its workers' out-of-pocket programme fees. The CTC grant will help to offset some of these training costs, and provide enhanced funding for absentee payroll when the trainee is away from work.
c. So these are tangible benefits that companies can enjoy and we encourage all companies to press on with their workforce and business transformation.


As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

51. Companies also need capital to execute their growth plans.
a. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists, and private equity firms.
b. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.
c. Over the past five years, we have set aside over $\$ 1.8$ billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a 3- to 7-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.

52. Globally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises.
a. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises.
b. So we will introduce a new $\$ 1$ billion Private Credit Growth Fund.
c. This will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply.
53. As enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia.

54. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.
a. The Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to MOF, just in time for the Budget.
b. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets.

b. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore.

c. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments, and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.
d. Since then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies.
e. One such development is that of small modular reactors (or SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.
f. Interest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.

62. We will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area.
a. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation.
b. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs.
c. Within the Government, we will reorganise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options, and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and costeffective way.
d. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.

63. Be it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure.
a. And that's why we established the Future Energy Fund last year.
b. I will top up the Fund by $\$ 5$ billion.
c. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.
64. Our efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.
65. 

We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS."
How does the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes work?,"The COMPASS framework is designed to provide a more nuanced approach to managing foreign workers in Singapore. It aims to strike a balance between allowing skilled foreign workers to contribute to the economy and ensuring that they do not displace local workers. The framework likely involves a set of criteria and guidelines that employers must follow when hiring foreign workers, with the goal of promoting fair competition and protecting the interests of both foreign and local workers.","b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.

# Supporting Singaporeans

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

# A Singapore Government Agency Website How to identify $\cdot$

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

# A. Introduction 

Mr Speaker, Sir

1. I move that Parliament approve the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.
2. 2025 marks our $60^{\text {th }}$ year of independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.
3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:
a. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.
b. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

4. As a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges.
a. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant.
b. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.
c. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.
5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.
a. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.
b. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.
c. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.

6. Today, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.
7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.
8.

# Support for Singaporeans 

Apr 2025 - Mar 2026
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence."
How long has the SkillsFuture initiative been in place?,It has been 10 years since the initiative was started.,"But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

# Encouraging Lifelong Learning 

70. At last year's Budget, I introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, to support mid-career Singaporeans in getting a significant skills reboot.
a. Under the programme, all Singaporeans aged 40 years and above will get $\$ 4,000$ in SkillsFuture Credit.
b. From next month, individuals can apply for a training allowance of up to $\$ 3,000$ per month for selected full-time courses. They will have 24 months' worth of allowance, which is up to $\$ 72,000$ per worker.
71. 

# Menggalakkan Pembelajaran Sepanjang Hayat 

- Program Peningkatan SkillsFuture untuk rakyat Singapura berusia 40 tahun dan ke atas
- Elaun latihan bulanan baharu sebanyak $\mathbf{\$ 3 0 0}$ mulai awal 2026 untuk kursuskursus separuh masa tertentu
- Mempertingkatkan Bantuan Kemahiran Daya Kerja mulai awal 2026 untuk para pekerja bergaji rendah berusia 30 tahun dan ke atas
- Elaun latihan bulanan untuk kursuskursus separuh masa dan sepenuh masa tertentu
![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

# Strengthening Support for Workers 

91. Even with reskilling and upskilling, some workers may face career setbacks due to economic and business disruptions.
92. We will help workers who lose their jobs to get back on their feet through the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, which will start from April this year. The scheme will provide financial support of up to $\$ 6,000$ over six months, to give our workers assurance as they undergo training or search for jobs.
93. 

# Encouraging Lifelong Learning 

- SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for Singaporeans aged 40 and above
- New \$300 monthly training allowance from early 2026 for selected part-time courses
- Enhance Workfare Skills Support from early 2026 for lower-wage workers aged 30 and above
- Monthly training allowance for selected part-time and full-time courses
![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.

We will also give a further boost to our lower-wage workers, who will benefit from early upskilling.
a. Today, our lower-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Skills Support Scheme from the age of 30.
b. The scheme provides employers with absentee payroll support when they sponsor workers for training. It also provides workers with a training allowance when they go for self-sponsored training.
74. Currently, the Workfare Skills Support Scheme is designed primarily to support short courses that are completed over a few days. But lower-wage workers stand to benefit more from longerform courses that provide more substantial reskilling and upskilling.
75. We will therefore introduce an enhanced tier of support under the Workfare Skills Support for lower-wage workers. This enhanced support will be modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, and will benefit lower-wage workers when they turn 30. So this will start earlier at age 30. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the Committee of Supply (COS).

76. Our Institutes of Higher Learning are key partners in supporting lifelong learning. They equip our workers with relevant skills for a changing economy, and provide a dedicated setting for deep learning.
a. We will support the Singapore University of Social Sciences (or SUSS) in developing a new city campus. This will enable SUSS to champion lifelong learning and deliver programmes with a strong social emphasis, at an accessible location in the city for learners of all ages.
b. We will also extend the Singapore Universities Trust by 10 years to 31 March 2042 to support the fundraising efforts of our newer Autonomous Universities, namely SUSS and the Singapore Institute of Technology. The Trust provides matching grants for donations, to support our Autonomous Universities in building up their endowment funds.
77. Sir, the Government is fully committed to supporting the lifelong employability of our workers. We cannot stop the waves of technological innovations. Nor can we save every job. But we can and we will invest in every worker and every Singaporean. We will equip everyone with the skills to adapt, compete and succeed in a changing economy.

## Supporting Workforce Transformation

- New SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant with up to 70\% funding support for job redesign
- Redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit with \$10,000 for eligible companies from second half of 2026 to offset out-ofpocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives
- Additional \$200 million for NTUC's Company Training Committee Grant to help more companies transform and upskill their workers

They can write better programming code than many experts, assist in complex problemsolving, and even help to accelerate research breakthroughs.
69. Al will get better in the future, and other new disruptive technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant. That's why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning, and have made significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our social compact.

Let me show how companies can benefit from all of these initiatives in a concrete way. Take for example SATS, our main air cargo handler and airline caterer at Changi Airport.
a. SATS is investing in new equipment and technology to improve the efficiency of its catering services. It also needs to train its workers to handle the new equipment, and redesign workflows and jobs.
b. It can access the additional \$10,000 in SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. It can tap on the new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant to cover up to $90 \%$ of the cost for reskilling workers, and up to $70 \%$ of the cost for redesigning jobs.

89. SATS has worked with NTUC to form a CTC, and has been sending its employees for the Work-Study Diploma in Airport Operations at ITE.
a. The Work-Study Diploma helps these employees acquire critical skills, including managing operations and resource planning. And they can go on to take on supervisory roles in SATS, subject to good performance.
b. Currently, SATS fully sponsors its workers' out-of-pocket programme fees. The CTC grant will help to offset some of these training costs, and provide enhanced funding for absentee payroll when the trainee is away from work.
c. So these are tangible benefits that companies can enjoy and we encourage all companies to press on with their workforce and business transformation.
"
What is the purpose of the SkillsFuture initiative?,"The purpose of the SkillsFuture initiative is to equip workers with the skills needed to stay competitive in an ever-changing job market. It aims to support lifelong learning and provide various forms of financial assistance to individuals, including those who have lost their jobs, to help them reskill or upskill. The initiative also seeks to simplify and streamline existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, making it more accessible for companies and workers alike.","But we are not resting on our laurels.

We will also give a further boost to our lower-wage workers, who will benefit from early upskilling.
a. Today, our lower-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Skills Support Scheme from the age of 30.
b. The scheme provides employers with absentee payroll support when they sponsor workers for training. It also provides workers with a training allowance when they go for self-sponsored training.
74. Currently, the Workfare Skills Support Scheme is designed primarily to support short courses that are completed over a few days. But lower-wage workers stand to benefit more from longerform courses that provide more substantial reskilling and upskilling.
75. We will therefore introduce an enhanced tier of support under the Workfare Skills Support for lower-wage workers. This enhanced support will be modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, and will benefit lower-wage workers when they turn 30. So this will start earlier at age 30. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the Committee of Supply (COS).

76. Our Institutes of Higher Learning are key partners in supporting lifelong learning. They equip our workers with relevant skills for a changing economy, and provide a dedicated setting for deep learning.
a. We will support the Singapore University of Social Sciences (or SUSS) in developing a new city campus. This will enable SUSS to champion lifelong learning and deliver programmes with a strong social emphasis, at an accessible location in the city for learners of all ages.
b. We will also extend the Singapore Universities Trust by 10 years to 31 March 2042 to support the fundraising efforts of our newer Autonomous Universities, namely SUSS and the Singapore Institute of Technology. The Trust provides matching grants for donations, to support our Autonomous Universities in building up their endowment funds.
77. Sir, the Government is fully committed to supporting the lifelong employability of our workers. We cannot stop the waves of technological innovations. Nor can we save every job. But we can and we will invest in every worker and every Singaporean. We will equip everyone with the skills to adapt, compete and succeed in a changing economy.

Let me show how companies can benefit from all of these initiatives in a concrete way. Take for example SATS, our main air cargo handler and airline caterer at Changi Airport.
a. SATS is investing in new equipment and technology to improve the efficiency of its catering services. It also needs to train its workers to handle the new equipment, and redesign workflows and jobs.
b. It can access the additional \$10,000 in SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. It can tap on the new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant to cover up to $90 \%$ of the cost for reskilling workers, and up to $70 \%$ of the cost for redesigning jobs.

89. SATS has worked with NTUC to form a CTC, and has been sending its employees for the Work-Study Diploma in Airport Operations at ITE.
a. The Work-Study Diploma helps these employees acquire critical skills, including managing operations and resource planning. And they can go on to take on supervisory roles in SATS, subject to good performance.
b. Currently, SATS fully sponsors its workers' out-of-pocket programme fees. The CTC grant will help to offset some of these training costs, and provide enhanced funding for absentee payroll when the trainee is away from work.
c. So these are tangible benefits that companies can enjoy and we encourage all companies to press on with their workforce and business transformation.

What is the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme and who is it intended for?,The SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme is a programme introduced to support mid-career Singaporeans in getting a significant skills reboot. It is intended for Singaporeans aged 40 years and above.,"# Encouraging Lifelong Learning 

70. At last year's Budget, I introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, to support mid-career Singaporeans in getting a significant skills reboot.
a. Under the programme, all Singaporeans aged 40 years and above will get $\$ 4,000$ in SkillsFuture Credit.
b. From next month, individuals can apply for a training allowance of up to $\$ 3,000$ per month for selected full-time courses. They will have 24 months' worth of allowance, which is up to $\$ 72,000$ per worker.
71. 

# Encouraging Lifelong Learning 

- SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for Singaporeans aged 40 and above
- New \$300 monthly training allowance from early 2026 for selected part-time courses
- Enhance Workfare Skills Support from early 2026 for lower-wage workers aged 30 and above
- Monthly training allowance for selected part-time and full-time courses
![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

# Strengthening Support for Workers 

91. Even with reskilling and upskilling, some workers may face career setbacks due to economic and business disruptions.
92. We will help workers who lose their jobs to get back on their feet through the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, which will start from April this year. The scheme will provide financial support of up to $\$ 6,000$ over six months, to give our workers assurance as they undergo training or search for jobs.
93.

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85. 

We will also give a further boost to our lower-wage workers, who will benefit from early upskilling.
a. Today, our lower-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Skills Support Scheme from the age of 30.
b. The scheme provides employers with absentee payroll support when they sponsor workers for training. It also provides workers with a training allowance when they go for self-sponsored training.
74. Currently, the Workfare Skills Support Scheme is designed primarily to support short courses that are completed over a few days. But lower-wage workers stand to benefit more from longerform courses that provide more substantial reskilling and upskilling.
75. We will therefore introduce an enhanced tier of support under the Workfare Skills Support for lower-wage workers. This enhanced support will be modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, and will benefit lower-wage workers when they turn 30. So this will start earlier at age 30. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the Committee of Supply (COS).

77. Sir, the Government is fully committed to supporting the lifelong employability of our workers. We cannot stop the waves of technological innovations. Nor can we save every job. But we can and we will invest in every worker and every Singaporean. We will equip everyone with the skills to adapt, compete and succeed in a changing economy.

## Supporting Workforce Transformation

- New SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant with up to 70\% funding support for job redesign
- Redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit with \$10,000 for eligible companies from second half of 2026 to offset out-ofpocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives
- Additional \$200 million for NTUC's Company Training Committee Grant to help more companies transform and upskill their workers

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

They can write better programming code than many experts, assist in complex problemsolving, and even help to accelerate research breakthroughs.
69. Al will get better in the future, and other new disruptive technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant. That's why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning, and have made significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our social compact."
What are the positive outcomes of Singapore's approach to foreign workers?,"Low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes, and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.","b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
9. 

99. For ex-offenders, employment is integral to their reintegration into society. To encourage employers to give ex-offenders a second chance, we had earlier introduced the Uplifting Employment Credit, which provides a wage offset to employers hiring ex-offenders.

a. Last year, the credit supported close to 700 employers in hiring more than 1,500 ex-offenders.
b. To encourage more employers to hire ex-offenders, I will extend the Uplifting Employment Credit to end-2028.
100. Sir, Singaporeans are at the core of everything we do. We will do everything we can to develop and realise the potential of all our people, so that they, in turn, realise their aspirations and dreams for themselves and their families.

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy.

23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.

c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

This is what economic dynamism and growth can deliver for our people. And so we will keep our economy strong and vibrant, and ensure that there are even more opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans - both now and in the future.

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

# Supporting Singaporeans 

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

We will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC's e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints islandwide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes, and prepare them for interviews.
94. Besides nationwide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.
a. Today, North East CDC runs Job Placement Centres for its district, in partnership with WSG. The centres have yielded meaningful outcomes.

b. We will expand localised job matching to all CDCs across the island.
95. We will also strengthen our support for two groups of workers in this Budget - seniors and ex-offenders.
96. More seniors are staying employed as our population ages. We want to work with employers to tap on the experience and wisdom of seniors who are able and wish to continue working.
a. In the immediate term, I will extend the Senior Employment

Credit (or SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $\$ 4,000$ a month.
b. In line with the increase in the re-employment age, I will raise the qualifying age for the highest SEC wage support tier to 69 years old, from 68 years old today. The Government will reimburse companies up to $7 \%$ of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.

97. Later this year, MOM will convene a Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment. The workgroup will undertake a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies, to improve the employability of seniors, and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.
98. In line with the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, we will proceed with the next step of planned CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers. We will increase the CPF contribution rates for those aged above 55 to 65 by 1.5 percentage points in 2026.
a. We will also continue to provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2026.
b. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost.


# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.
"
How does the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme assist those who are involuntarily unemployed?,"The SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme provides financial support of up to $6,000 over six months to help workers who lose their jobs get back on their feet while they undergo training or search for new jobs. This assistance aims to give workers assurance as they transition to a new role.","# Strengthening Support for Workers 

91. Even with reskilling and upskilling, some workers may face career setbacks due to economic and business disruptions.
92. We will help workers who lose their jobs to get back on their feet through the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, which will start from April this year. The scheme will provide financial support of up to $\$ 6,000$ over six months, to give our workers assurance as they undergo training or search for jobs.

This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.

c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85. 

We will also give a further boost to our lower-wage workers, who will benefit from early upskilling.
a. Today, our lower-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Skills Support Scheme from the age of 30.
b. The scheme provides employers with absentee payroll support when they sponsor workers for training. It also provides workers with a training allowance when they go for self-sponsored training.
74. Currently, the Workfare Skills Support Scheme is designed primarily to support short courses that are completed over a few days. But lower-wage workers stand to benefit more from longerform courses that provide more substantial reskilling and upskilling.
75. We will therefore introduce an enhanced tier of support under the Workfare Skills Support for lower-wage workers. This enhanced support will be modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, and will benefit lower-wage workers when they turn 30. So this will start earlier at age 30. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the Committee of Supply (COS).

76. Our Institutes of Higher Learning are key partners in supporting lifelong learning. They equip our workers with relevant skills for a changing economy, and provide a dedicated setting for deep learning.
a. We will support the Singapore University of Social Sciences (or SUSS) in developing a new city campus. This will enable SUSS to champion lifelong learning and deliver programmes with a strong social emphasis, at an accessible location in the city for learners of all ages.
b. We will also extend the Singapore Universities Trust by 10 years to 31 March 2042 to support the fundraising efforts of our newer Autonomous Universities, namely SUSS and the Singapore Institute of Technology. The Trust provides matching grants for donations, to support our Autonomous Universities in building up their endowment funds.
77. Sir, the Government is fully committed to supporting the lifelong employability of our workers. We cannot stop the waves of technological innovations. Nor can we save every job. But we can and we will invest in every worker and every Singaporean. We will equip everyone with the skills to adapt, compete and succeed in a changing economy.

We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.


Let me show how companies can benefit from all of these initiatives in a concrete way. Take for example SATS, our main air cargo handler and airline caterer at Changi Airport.
a. SATS is investing in new equipment and technology to improve the efficiency of its catering services. It also needs to train its workers to handle the new equipment, and redesign workflows and jobs.
b. It can access the additional \$10,000 in SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. It can tap on the new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant to cover up to $90 \%$ of the cost for reskilling workers, and up to $70 \%$ of the cost for redesigning jobs.

89. SATS has worked with NTUC to form a CTC, and has been sending its employees for the Work-Study Diploma in Airport Operations at ITE.
a. The Work-Study Diploma helps these employees acquire critical skills, including managing operations and resource planning. And they can go on to take on supervisory roles in SATS, subject to good performance.
b. Currently, SATS fully sponsors its workers' out-of-pocket programme fees. The CTC grant will help to offset some of these training costs, and provide enhanced funding for absentee payroll when the trainee is away from work.
c. So these are tangible benefits that companies can enjoy and we encourage all companies to press on with their workforce and business transformation.


But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

# Encouraging Lifelong Learning 

70. At last year's Budget, I introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, to support mid-career Singaporeans in getting a significant skills reboot.
a. Under the programme, all Singaporeans aged 40 years and above will get $\$ 4,000$ in SkillsFuture Credit.
b. From next month, individuals can apply for a training allowance of up to $\$ 3,000$ per month for selected full-time courses. They will have 24 months' worth of allowance, which is up to $\$ 72,000$ per worker.
71. 

99. For ex-offenders, employment is integral to their reintegration into society. To encourage employers to give ex-offenders a second chance, we had earlier introduced the Uplifting Employment Credit, which provides a wage offset to employers hiring ex-offenders.

a. Last year, the credit supported close to 700 employers in hiring more than 1,500 ex-offenders.
b. To encourage more employers to hire ex-offenders, I will extend the Uplifting Employment Credit to end-2028.
100. Sir, Singaporeans are at the core of everything we do. We will do everything we can to develop and realise the potential of all our people, so that they, in turn, realise their aspirations and dreams for themselves and their families.

## Supporting Workforce Transformation

- New SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant with up to 70\% funding support for job redesign
- Redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit with \$10,000 for eligible companies from second half of 2026 to offset out-ofpocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives
- Additional \$200 million for NTUC's Company Training Committee Grant to help more companies transform and upskill their workers

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

# Encouraging Lifelong Learning 

- SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for Singaporeans aged 40 and above
- New \$300 monthly training allowance from early 2026 for selected part-time courses
- Enhance Workfare Skills Support from early 2026 for lower-wage workers aged 30 and above
- Monthly training allowance for selected part-time and full-time courses

What steps is the government taking to strengthen SkillsFuture?,"The government has taken several decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture, including introducing the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers and the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed. They have also made further moves to nurture promising Singaporean corporate leaders through a talent development strategy and will be supporting senior worker employment.","But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

# Strengthening Support for Workers 

91. Even with reskilling and upskilling, some workers may face career setbacks due to economic and business disruptions.
92. We will help workers who lose their jobs to get back on their feet through the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, which will start from April this year. The scheme will provide financial support of up to $\$ 6,000$ over six months, to give our workers assurance as they undergo training or search for jobs.
93. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85.

# Menggalakkan Pembelajaran Sepanjang Hayat 

- Program Peningkatan SkillsFuture untuk rakyat Singapura berusia 40 tahun dan ke atas
- Elaun latihan bulanan baharu sebanyak $\mathbf{\$ 3 0 0}$ mulai awal 2026 untuk kursuskursus separuh masa tertentu
- Mempertingkatkan Bantuan Kemahiran Daya Kerja mulai awal 2026 untuk para pekerja bergaji rendah berusia 30 tahun dan ke atas
- Elaun latihan bulanan untuk kursuskursus separuh masa dan sepenuh masa tertentu
![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

To be clear, this is not about Government spending. We are prepared to spend more where necessary.
a. But it's equally, if not more, important to get the policies right.
b. And to ensure the overall system is fiscally sound and sustainable.
43. And on that basis, we have been taking steps to progressively strengthen the key pillars of our social support and our social compact.
a. We started in Singapore with the basics: universal access to primary school for education; CPF for retirement; government subsidies and the 3Ms for healthcare; and HDB for housing.
b. And we've progressively enhanced these pillars - Workfare for lowerwage workers; Silver Support for the more vulnerable seniors; and SkillsFuture to support all our workers.
44. 

They can write better programming code than many experts, assist in complex problemsolving, and even help to accelerate research breakthroughs.
69. Al will get better in the future, and other new disruptive technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant. That's why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning, and have made significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our social compact.

We will also give a further boost to our lower-wage workers, who will benefit from early upskilling.
a. Today, our lower-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Skills Support Scheme from the age of 30.
b. The scheme provides employers with absentee payroll support when they sponsor workers for training. It also provides workers with a training allowance when they go for self-sponsored training.
74. Currently, the Workfare Skills Support Scheme is designed primarily to support short courses that are completed over a few days. But lower-wage workers stand to benefit more from longerform courses that provide more substantial reskilling and upskilling.
75. We will therefore introduce an enhanced tier of support under the Workfare Skills Support for lower-wage workers. This enhanced support will be modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, and will benefit lower-wage workers when they turn 30. So this will start earlier at age 30. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the Committee of Supply (COS).

76. Our Institutes of Higher Learning are key partners in supporting lifelong learning. They equip our workers with relevant skills for a changing economy, and provide a dedicated setting for deep learning.
a. We will support the Singapore University of Social Sciences (or SUSS) in developing a new city campus. This will enable SUSS to champion lifelong learning and deliver programmes with a strong social emphasis, at an accessible location in the city for learners of all ages.
b. We will also extend the Singapore Universities Trust by 10 years to 31 March 2042 to support the fundraising efforts of our newer Autonomous Universities, namely SUSS and the Singapore Institute of Technology. The Trust provides matching grants for donations, to support our Autonomous Universities in building up their endowment funds.
77. Sir, the Government is fully committed to supporting the lifelong employability of our workers. We cannot stop the waves of technological innovations. Nor can we save every job. But we can and we will invest in every worker and every Singaporean. We will equip everyone with the skills to adapt, compete and succeed in a changing economy.

Sir, we are taking concrete steps to strengthen our social support system. In this Budget, l've focused on families, seniors and their long-term care needs, and persons with disabilities. But we will continue to review and update other policy areas over time. This is the Government's key priority. Because we want to build a Singapore where we have each other's backs, where no one is left behind, and where we continue to stay strong and united as one people."
Which MPs have spoken about the concerns related to job transformation and technological advances?,Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this.,"# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.


Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.
iii. 

# D. Equipping Workers Throughout Life 

67. A growing economy creates more well-paying jobs. But the jobs of the future will not be the same as the jobs of today. Rapid technological advances, especially in Al, will transform workplaces and jobs.
68. Just a few years ago, tools like ChatGPT didn't even exist. Now there is a rapidly expanding ecosystem of Al models. They can generate high-quality text, images, and videos. 

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

And so these are issues we will continue to fine tune in terms of means testing criteria.
b. Ms Jean See, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlighted other groups that may need more support such as freelance and agency

workers, as well as working mothers.
c. Ms Usha Chandradas earlier championed for the arts, and Mr Ong Hua Han reminded us to ensure our arts and sports scene remains inclusive.
d. And Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Rachel Ong advocated for mental health issues.
e. These are some of the key points members have raised.


As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

# Ensuring No One Is Left Behind 

46. This same approach applies to other areas, which many members spoke about.
a. For example, many MPs, Mr Vikram Nair, Associate Professor Razwana Begum, Ms Hany Soh, Mr Alex Yam, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Mr Louis

Ng, and Ms Carrie Tan, amongst others, spoke about more support for families, and support not just in financial terms, but also leave arrangements, which was a popular refrain from the speeches. We will have to look at all these suggestions.
b. Others like Ms Denise Phua, Mr Don Wee, Mr Ang Wei Neng, and Mr Sharael Taha have highlighted the need for more inclusive hiring practices and employment support for Persons with Disabilities. I agree we must do more for Persons with Disabilities. And in my Budget statement, I said we are embarking on a comprehensive study to look at post-18 pathways for people with disabilities, and we will want to do more for them.
c. Many members like SPS Eric Chua, Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Xie Yao Quan, and Mr Dennis Tan also spoke about the need to help our seniors age well and ensure they are not left behind in their silver years.
d. In fact we have made significant moves over the past 1-2 years to support these groups, including at this Budget.
e. But our attitude is we are never satisfied with the status quo, and will continue to review and study how we can make things better.
47. Likewise on the subject of caregivers, which many members spoke about, including Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Sharael Taha, Ms Ng Ling Ling, Ms Joan Pereira, and Dr Tan Wu Meng.
a. Caregiving arrangements vary from family to family - some have sole caregivers, while others will share the responsibility over several family members.
b. We recognise the crucial role caregivers play and the sacrifices they make, such as leaving employment to care for family arrangements, or forgoing their careers to spend more time to take care of their family

members. We want to provide support for those who have to take up this role, as it is not easy for them.
c. It is difficult to put a monetary value on caregiving. And furthermore, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to support caregivers. So our approach has been to provide support for the family as a whole.
d. And in this Budget, we have significantly enhanced the Home Caregiving Grant, and increased subsidies for care services in nursing homes and in the community.
e. But this not the end of our moves. In fact, we will study more to see how we can further strengthen our support for caregivers.
48. 

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

13. Our more important effort is really to help companies consolidate, restructure, and transform. That's something the Government can encourage, facilitate, and nudge. But in the end, the business owners themselves, the companies themselves must be prepared to make the change.
a. Take retail as an example.
b. Some retailers are concerned about the impact of the Johor-Singapore SEZ and the RTS Link.
c. But with e-commerce, competition is already happening. And it's happening and taking place from all over the world.
d. Today, Singapore consumers, all of us, can already purchase many items from abroad and have them shipped to their doorsteps at cheaper prices than the local retail price. There are many examples, you can look for yourself.


55. Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about the assets linked to the $\$ 3$ billion money laundering case, which have been surrendered to the state. These assets are progressively being liquidated and when they are liquidated, the monies will be added to the Consolidated Fund. These funds are not earmarked for specific purposes, and will be part of our overall revenues to fund the Government's budget.
56. Several members including Mr Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, Ms Hazel Poa, and Mr Leong Mun Wai questioned the need to increase the GST, given our strong fiscal position.
57. I should remind Members that we are in this strong fiscal position precisely because the Government took the necessary steps early in this term to raise revenues.
58. 

They can write better programming code than many experts, assist in complex problemsolving, and even help to accelerate research breakthroughs.
69. Al will get better in the future, and other new disruptive technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant. That's why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning, and have made significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our social compact."
What measures has Singapore introduced to protect against workplace discrimination?,The Workplace Fairness Act is one of the measures introduced by Singapore to protect against workplace discrimination.,"b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.

And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

99. For ex-offenders, employment is integral to their reintegration into society. To encourage employers to give ex-offenders a second chance, we had earlier introduced the Uplifting Employment Credit, which provides a wage offset to employers hiring ex-offenders.

a. Last year, the credit supported close to 700 employers in hiring more than 1,500 ex-offenders.
b. To encourage more employers to hire ex-offenders, I will extend the Uplifting Employment Credit to end-2028.
100. Sir, Singaporeans are at the core of everything we do. We will do everything we can to develop and realise the potential of all our people, so that they, in turn, realise their aspirations and dreams for themselves and their families.

- Extend Enabling Employment Credit to 2028 to offset wages for hiring persons with disabilities
- Higher subsidy rates for adult disability services with more households covered
- Matched Retirement Savings Scheme for Singaporeans with disabilities of all ages
- Matching grant for top-ups by caregivers to Special Needs Trust Company trust accounts

!

159. Many businesses have also stepped forward to support their fellow Singaporeans in this SG60 year, and will be providing special SG60 discounts and offers. I would like to encourage more businesses to join in and offer their support.

160. Singapore is at its strongest when we stand together. We may have our differences. But we are all Singaporeans, living on this tiny red dot, as one family. When we rally together as one, there is no challenge we cannot overcome. And this unity is what keeps us resilient, thriving, and moving forward, even in an uncertain and troubled world.

We will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC's e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints islandwide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes, and prepare them for interviews.
94. Besides nationwide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.
a. Today, North East CDC runs Job Placement Centres for its district, in partnership with WSG. The centres have yielded meaningful outcomes.

b. We will expand localised job matching to all CDCs across the island.
95. We will also strengthen our support for two groups of workers in this Budget - seniors and ex-offenders.
96. More seniors are staying employed as our population ages. We want to work with employers to tap on the experience and wisdom of seniors who are able and wish to continue working.
a. In the immediate term, I will extend the Senior Employment

Credit (or SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $\$ 4,000$ a month.
b. In line with the increase in the re-employment age, I will raise the qualifying age for the highest SEC wage support tier to 69 years old, from 68 years old today. The Government will reimburse companies up to $7 \%$ of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.

97. Later this year, MOM will convene a Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment. The workgroup will undertake a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies, to improve the employability of seniors, and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.
98. In line with the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, we will proceed with the next step of planned CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers. We will increase the CPF contribution rates for those aged above 55 to 65 by 1.5 percentage points in 2026.
a. We will also continue to provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2026.
b. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost.


# Supporting Singaporeans 

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

144. 

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now."
What are the goals of the talent development strategy mentioned in the context?,"The goal of the talent development strategy is to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector. This includes providing support to equip Singaporeans with the skills and experience needed to succeed on their own merit, particularly for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities. The ultimate aim is to grow a leadership pipeline that can compete with regional and global standards.","90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

And so these are issues we will continue to fine tune in terms of means testing criteria.
b. Ms Jean See, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh highlighted other groups that may need more support such as freelance and agency

workers, as well as working mothers.
c. Ms Usha Chandradas earlier championed for the arts, and Mr Ong Hua Han reminded us to ensure our arts and sports scene remains inclusive.
d. And Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Rachel Ong advocated for mental health issues.
e. These are some of the key points members have raised.


## Supporting Workforce Transformation

- New SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant with up to 70\% funding support for job redesign
- Redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit with \$10,000 for eligible companies from second half of 2026 to offset out-ofpocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives
- Additional \$200 million for NTUC's Company Training Committee Grant to help more companies transform and upskill their workers

Let me show how companies can benefit from all of these initiatives in a concrete way. Take for example SATS, our main air cargo handler and airline caterer at Changi Airport.
a. SATS is investing in new equipment and technology to improve the efficiency of its catering services. It also needs to train its workers to handle the new equipment, and redesign workflows and jobs.
b. It can access the additional \$10,000 in SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. It can tap on the new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant to cover up to $90 \%$ of the cost for reskilling workers, and up to $70 \%$ of the cost for redesigning jobs.

89. SATS has worked with NTUC to form a CTC, and has been sending its employees for the Work-Study Diploma in Airport Operations at ITE.
a. The Work-Study Diploma helps these employees acquire critical skills, including managing operations and resource planning. And they can go on to take on supervisory roles in SATS, subject to good performance.
b. Currently, SATS fully sponsors its workers' out-of-pocket programme fees. The CTC grant will help to offset some of these training costs, and provide enhanced funding for absentee payroll when the trainee is away from work.
c. So these are tangible benefits that companies can enjoy and we encourage all companies to press on with their workforce and business transformation.


# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.
85. 

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

144. 

To achieve this, we must continue to uphold several fundamentals. That includes:
a. Maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies;
b. Harnessing market forces to drive efficiency and innovation;
c. Staying open to people and ideas to strengthen our capabilities;
d. And deepening our tripartite partnership as a cornerstone of economic stability.
36. At the same time, our approach and strategy must adapt to changing circumstances.
a. At this stage of development, we can no longer compete on cost alone. Instead, we must differentiate ourselves by producing high-value solutions for the world.
b. To take our economy forward, this Budget will emphasise three key areas: technology and innovation, our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our infrastructure investments amidst resource constraints.

We will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC's e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints islandwide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes, and prepare them for interviews.
94. Besides nationwide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.
a. Today, North East CDC runs Job Placement Centres for its district, in partnership with WSG. The centres have yielded meaningful outcomes.

b. We will expand localised job matching to all CDCs across the island.
95. We will also strengthen our support for two groups of workers in this Budget - seniors and ex-offenders.
96. More seniors are staying employed as our population ages. We want to work with employers to tap on the experience and wisdom of seniors who are able and wish to continue working.
a. In the immediate term, I will extend the Senior Employment

Credit (or SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $\$ 4,000$ a month.

b. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost.


# Building a Strong and Sustainable Social Support System 

33. These are desired outcomes which I'm sure we can all agree to. The question is how do we achieve them.

How is the Singaporean government planning to support senior worker employment according to the budget?,"The Singaporean government plans to support senior worker employment by extending the Senior Employment Credit (SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $4,000 a month. Additionally, the Government will reimburse companies up to 7% of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.","Sir, we are taking concrete steps to strengthen our social support system. In this Budget, l've focused on families, seniors and their long-term care needs, and persons with disabilities. But we will continue to review and update other policy areas over time. This is the Government's key priority. Because we want to build a Singapore where we have each other's backs, where no one is left behind, and where we continue to stay strong and united as one people.

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.

## Empowering Persons with Disabilities

![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

- Extend Enabling Employment Credit to 2028 to offset wages for hiring persons with disabilities
- Higher subsidy rates for adult disability services with more households covered
- Matched Retirement Savings Scheme for Singaporeans with disabilities of all ages
- Matching grant for top-ups by caregivers to Special Needs Trust Company trust accounts

!

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

144. 

Now the baton has been passed to us. It is our turn to take Singapore forward.

The world is in flux, and uncertainties abound. To tackle the challenges ahead, we must stay united and work together as one.

Forward Singapore provides a roadmap for our next phase. It involves major resets in our policies and our mindsets to strengthen our social compact.

Budget 2025 will advance this agenda. It is a Budget for all Singaporeans. It is a Budget shaped together with all of you.

We will tackle cost pressures, and provide stronger support for families, seniors, and vulnerable groups.

We will advance our growth frontier by fostering innovation, expanding access to clean energy, and ensuring our workers have the skills to realise their full potential.

We will build a sustainable city, and secure a better and greener future for all.

We will nurture a caring society and an inclusive home - one where every Singaporean feels valued and supported.

Let us rally as one united people and move onward together for a better tomorrow.

But despite the uncertainties, we can look ahead with a degree of confidence. Singapore today is far stronger than we were 60 years ago.
a. We have developed a strong and well-diversified economy, supported by a highly skilled workforce.
b. We have built up a robust SAF and a strong diplomatic network, to uphold our sovereignty and security.
c. We have forged a common Singaporean identity, grounded in our shared values and experiences, and our commitment to one another and our nation.
14. This is the legacy of generations of Singaporeans, with each one running a good race. The baton has now been passed, and it is our turn to take Singapore forward. This Budget builds on previous Budgets, not only to address today's challenges, but to plan ahead and secure Singapore's future.
15. Budget 2025 is a Budget for all Singaporeans.

16. It's also a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans. It further advances our Forward Singapore agenda, which incorporates your aspirations and views, and seeks to keep our society strong and united.
17. In this Budget, we will work with you to:
a. Tackle cost pressures;
b. Advance our growth frontier;
c. Equip workers throughout life;
d. Build a sustainable city;
e. Nurture a caring and inclusive society; and
f. Rally as one united people.

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

3. The questions raised by Members during this debate revolve around three main issues:
a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

# Strengthening Our National Identity and Our Community Bonds 

148. Our unity is a precious asset, which we must never take for granted. The experiences of countries around the world show how easy it is for trust to be eroded, and for societies to become deeply divided and polarised.
149. We must therefore remain steadfast in nurturing our cohesion and unity. And in this Budget, we will invest more in strengthening our cultural core and our community bonds.
150. We will introduce an SG Culture Pass, to encourage Singaporeans to attend arts and heritage activities.
a. All Singaporeans aged 18 and above this year will receive $\$ 100$ worth of credits, which they can use for eligible activities, like arts and cultural performances, museum exhibitions, and heritage experiences.
b. The credits will be made available from September this year, and are valid until the end of 2028.

c. The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth will share more about upcoming initiatives for the arts and heritage sector.
151. Our hawker centres and markets are an integral part of our way of life. This year marks over half a century since we built our first hawker centres and markets, and the fifth anniversary of the inscription of our Hawker Culture onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
a. To appreciate our hawkers and market stallholders, we will give each stall in centres managed by Government and Government-appointed operators a one-time rental support of $\$ 600$ this year.
b. We will also allocate up to $\$ 1$ billion over the next 20 to 30 years to upgrade ageing hawker centres and to build new centres. This will serve the changing needs of our stallholders and patrons. The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment will provide more details at the COS.

152. Sports is another avenue for Singaporeans of all races, religions and backgrounds to come together. Last year, we cheered on Team Singapore at the Olympics and Paralympics, rejoicing as our flag was raised high. We celebrate with them when they do well, and we encourage them when they face setbacks.
153. We are building new facilities in our heartlands, so that Singaporeans can enjoy sports closer to where they live. In the coming years, we will have new sports facilities in Toa Payoh, Punggol, and Clementi. And we are also upgrading existing facilities in Pasir Ris, Queenstown, and Hougang.
154. We will provide $\$ 100$ in SG60 ActiveSG credits for all ActiveSG members to enjoy sports together with their family and friends. You can sign up for the free membership at the ActiveSG website, and use these credits to book ActiveSG facilities and programmes.
155. 

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

# Encouraging Lifelong Learning 

- SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for Singaporeans aged 40 and above
- New \$300 monthly training allowance from early 2026 for selected part-time courses
- Enhance Workfare Skills Support from early 2026 for lower-wage workers aged 30 and above
- Monthly training allowance for selected part-time and full-time courses

What is the role of the Tripartite Workgroup in addressing senior worker employment issues?,The Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment plays a crucial role in undertaking a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies to improve the employability of seniors and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.,"We will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC's e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints islandwide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes, and prepare them for interviews.
94. Besides nationwide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.
a. Today, North East CDC runs Job Placement Centres for its district, in partnership with WSG. The centres have yielded meaningful outcomes.

b. We will expand localised job matching to all CDCs across the island.
95. We will also strengthen our support for two groups of workers in this Budget - seniors and ex-offenders.
96. More seniors are staying employed as our population ages. We want to work with employers to tap on the experience and wisdom of seniors who are able and wish to continue working.
a. In the immediate term, I will extend the Senior Employment

Credit (or SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $\$ 4,000$ a month.
b. In line with the increase in the re-employment age, I will raise the qualifying age for the highest SEC wage support tier to 69 years old, from 68 years old today. The Government will reimburse companies up to $7 \%$ of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.

97. Later this year, MOM will convene a Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment. The workgroup will undertake a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies, to improve the employability of seniors, and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.
98. In line with the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, we will proceed with the next step of planned CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers. We will increase the CPF contribution rates for those aged above 55 to 65 by 1.5 percentage points in 2026.
a. We will also continue to provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2026.
b. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost.


Our tripartite partners play key roles in workforce transformation. In particular, NTUC's Company Training Committees (or CTCs) bring union leaders and employers together to design and implement workforce upgrading plans.
86. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

144. 

## Empowering Persons with Disabilities

![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

- Extend Enabling Employment Credit to 2028 to offset wages for hiring persons with disabilities
- Higher subsidy rates for adult disability services with more households covered
- Matched Retirement Savings Scheme for Singaporeans with disabilities of all ages
- Matching grant for top-ups by caregivers to Special Needs Trust Company trust accounts

## Memperkukuh Sokongan Pekerjaan

- Imbangan Peralihan CPF bagi menampung separuh daripada kenaikan sumbangan CPF majikan untuk pekerja lanjut usia yang berusia lebih 55 tahun hingga 65 tahun
- Melanjutkan Kredit Pekerjaan Warga Emas hingga 2026 bagi mengimbangi gaji pekerja lanjut usia yang diambil bekerja
- Melanjutkan Kredit Peningkatan Pekerjaan hingga 2028 bagi mengimbangi gaji bekas pesalah yang diambil bekerja
![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)

# Ensuring No One Is Left Behind 

46. This same approach applies to other areas, which many members spoke about.
a. For example, many MPs, Mr Vikram Nair, Associate Professor Razwana Begum, Ms Hany Soh, Mr Alex Yam, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Mr Louis

Ng, and Ms Carrie Tan, amongst others, spoke about more support for families, and support not just in financial terms, but also leave arrangements, which was a popular refrain from the speeches. We will have to look at all these suggestions.
b. Others like Ms Denise Phua, Mr Don Wee, Mr Ang Wei Neng, and Mr Sharael Taha have highlighted the need for more inclusive hiring practices and employment support for Persons with Disabilities. I agree we must do more for Persons with Disabilities. And in my Budget statement, I said we are embarking on a comprehensive study to look at post-18 pathways for people with disabilities, and we will want to do more for them.
c. Many members like SPS Eric Chua, Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Xie Yao Quan, and Mr Dennis Tan also spoke about the need to help our seniors age well and ensure they are not left behind in their silver years.
d. In fact we have made significant moves over the past 1-2 years to support these groups, including at this Budget.
e. But our attitude is we are never satisfied with the status quo, and will continue to review and study how we can make things better.
47. Likewise on the subject of caregivers, which many members spoke about, including Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Sharael Taha, Ms Ng Ling Ling, Ms Joan Pereira, and Dr Tan Wu Meng.
a. Caregiving arrangements vary from family to family - some have sole caregivers, while others will share the responsibility over several family members.
b. We recognise the crucial role caregivers play and the sacrifices they make, such as leaving employment to care for family arrangements, or forgoing their careers to spend more time to take care of their family

members. We want to provide support for those who have to take up this role, as it is not easy for them.
c. It is difficult to put a monetary value on caregiving. And furthermore, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to support caregivers. So our approach has been to provide support for the family as a whole.
d. And in this Budget, we have significantly enhanced the Home Caregiving Grant, and increased subsidies for care services in nursing homes and in the community.
e. But this not the end of our moves. In fact, we will study more to see how we can further strengthen our support for caregivers.
48. 

## Strengthening Employment Support

- CPF Transition Offset to cover half the increase in employer CPF contributions for senior workers aged above 55 to 65
- Extend Senior Employment Credit to 2026 to offset wages for hiring senior workers
- Extend Uplifting Employment Credit to 2028 to offset wages for hiring ex-offenders

Let me address these three issues in turn."
Why is there a need to invest more in adult education and training compared to pre-employment training?,"Investing more in adult education and training is necessary because many countries have invested more in pre-employment training. This means that Singapore's approach may not be directly comparable, but rather it needs to find its own way forward.","They can write better programming code than many experts, assist in complex problemsolving, and even help to accelerate research breakthroughs.
69. Al will get better in the future, and other new disruptive technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant. That's why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning, and have made significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our social compact.

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.

144. 

To be clear, this is not about Government spending. We are prepared to spend more where necessary.
a. But it's equally, if not more, important to get the policies right.
b. And to ensure the overall system is fiscally sound and sustainable.
43. And on that basis, we have been taking steps to progressively strengthen the key pillars of our social support and our social compact.
a. We started in Singapore with the basics: universal access to primary school for education; CPF for retirement; government subsidies and the 3Ms for healthcare; and HDB for housing.
b. And we've progressively enhanced these pillars - Workfare for lowerwage workers; Silver Support for the more vulnerable seniors; and SkillsFuture to support all our workers.
44. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

# D. Equipping Workers Throughout Life 

67. A growing economy creates more well-paying jobs. But the jobs of the future will not be the same as the jobs of today. Rapid technological advances, especially in Al, will transform workplaces and jobs.
68. Just a few years ago, tools like ChatGPT didn't even exist. Now there is a rapidly expanding ecosystem of Al models. They can generate high-quality text, images, and videos. 

Some Singaporeans prefer to continue working, while upskilling on a part-time basis.
a. Take for example, Ms Zarina Binti Abdul Rahman. She started out as an intern in Randstad Sourceright, a global recruitment agency, and is now an office administrator.

b. She wants to upgrade her skills in business operations, but is unable to pursue full-time studies due to her work and family commitments. So she is pursuing a part-time Diploma in Business Practice at Nanyang Polytechnic.
72. While workers like Zarina continue to earn their salaries during part-time training, they also incur training-related expenses.
a. We will therefore extend the training allowance to workers undergoing part-time training.
b. They can enjoy a fixed allowance of $\$ 300$ per month to defray their learning expenses.
c. And this part-time training allowance will be implemented early next year.
d. The Minister for Education will share more at the Committee of Supply.

73. 

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



# Encouraging Lifelong Learning 

- SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for Singaporeans aged 40 and above
- New \$300 monthly training allowance from early 2026 for selected part-time courses
- Enhance Workfare Skills Support from early 2026 for lower-wage workers aged 30 and above
- Monthly training allowance for selected part-time and full-time courses
![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

But more importantly, let's look at the overall picture. We continue to have a highly progressive tax and transfer system.
a. Members are familiar with the benefits and tax ratios, which we highlight every budget. And it's worth going through them again.
b. The bottom quintile of households receives $\$ 4$ in benefits for every dollar of tax paid. Middle-income households also get more benefits than tax paid as you go through the income thresholds and levels.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
c. In fact, it's only the top quintile of income earners receives less in benefits, or 30 cents, for every dollar of tax paid. So this is what our system has achieved.
d. So these outcomes are a culmination of years of deliberate moves to enhance the progressivity of our overall taxes and transfers system.
75. There is no fiscal system in the world that can deliver perfect precision and equity. But I think we have found an approach in Singapore that works for us. It is not perfect, but we continue to make it better.

a. Here, everyone contributes to taxes. The lower and middle-income will receive more support, while the higher-income and wealthier segments of the population will contribute more. It's a fair and progressive tax and redistribution system, anchored on our values of a fair and just society.
b. And the strength of our fiscal system is internationally recognised. A recent OECD report commended Singapore on our robust fiscal system.
c. This is hard-earned credibility that we have built up over many, many decades. It is not something we should take for granted, because that same credibility can be quickly destroyed in the wrong hands.
76. And at the end of the day, something as fundamental as this, Singaporeans will decide.
77. Will they prefer a government that underestimates our needs, spends more from our hard-earned reserves, and leaves us weaker?
78. Or will they prefer a government that is steadfast, that upholds fiscal responsibility and discipline, and ensures we have enough resources for current and future generations to handle unexpected challenges?
a. Sir, the PAP's approach is clear: we take our duty as stewards of the country seriously. We remain true to our mission, and manage our finances carefully for the benefit of all Singaporeans, now and in the future.
b. We will continue to do our best to convince Singaporeans that ours is the right approach - it has served us well these last 60 years, and it will continue to keep Singapore on the right track in the years ahead.

But if we were to rewind the clock, and consider our situation, imagine what our situation was at the beginning of this decade.
a. We were in the thick of battle, fighting COVID.
b. I know it feels like a bad dream and a distant memory to all of us, but those were truly tough times. In 2020 alone, we had five budgets. In 2021 we had three budgets. We sought the President's approval five times to draw from Past Reserves.
c. And this is 2020, 2021. We had no way of knowing when the pandemic would end, how the virus would mutate, how many more new waves of infection we would face, how many more restrictions we have to impose, and how much deeper a fiscal hole we would end up with.
d. But we already knew for sure that spending needs would rise over the horizon. It was coming, year after year. Healthcare spending was rising,

especially with our rapidly ageing population.
e. We looked at different ways to raise revenues including through property and income taxes. But these moves were still not enough to cover the expected increase in expenditure, which was sure to happen.
59. So what should we do to plug the funding gap?
a. That's why we had to consider the GST increase.
b. It was a difficult decision. It was a difficult choice - it's never easy to raise taxes, and certainly not a tax like the GST.
c. But governance is about making responsible choices, not just popular ones. We must ask ourselves: Do we want short-term populism or longterm stability? Do we want to kick the can down the road or take the hard but necessary decisions?
60. So once there were signs that the economy had stabilised, we decided to proceed with the GST increase.
a. But we also rolled out a comprehensive Assurance Package, which effectively delayed the GST increase for the vast majority of Singaporean households.
b. Essentially, once we decided to move, the GST rates were locked in. But with the Assurance Package, we could be more responsive to changing circumstances. And we could push back effectively the impact of the GST increase.
c. And that's exactly what we did. We had multiple rounds of enhancements to the Assurance Package - to tackle cost-of-living concerns, and to ensure that the majority of households will not feel the impact of the additional GST for at least 5 years.

d. At the same time, we have a permanent GST Voucher, which we also enhanced, and this ensures that the GST and GST Voucher scheme, combined together, will support the lower-income groups and will protect them - not just over the next five or 10 years, but on a permanent and ongoing basis.
61. So with that in place, together with the other revenue moves we made, we are in a better position now. And now, the additional GST revenues have started to come in - and it's mostly, the revenues are mostly from those who are better-off, foreigners, as well as tourists. And it will give us the resources we need to improve our healthcare infrastructure, and take better care of our seniors.
62. What would have happened if we chose to avoid the GST increase because it is unpopular? Or if we did not enjoy the unexpected upsides in corporate income tax collections, which only emerged in the last two years?
a. We would have ended FY2024 in a deficit.
b. The projected balance in FY2025 would also have been a deficit.
c. And that would have meant less funding for essential services, less support for our seniors, and fewer resources to invest in our future.
d. Basically, Singapore and Singaporeans would have ended up in a much weaker position.
63. Several Members I know criticised MOF's fiscal marksmanship.
64. Look, when I started work in MOF decades ago, one of my main tasks was to provide fiscal projections. As an economist, that was what I did. I was one of those who would run the models, and churn out the figures. So I know exactly what this work entails and how difficult it is.
a. I will not defend the figures if they are off the mark.

b. But I will speak up for our MOF officers who do this work with dedication and professionalism against any unfair criticisms.
65. Ultimately, a budget is a projection - it is based on the best available information at that point in time.
a. We have to plan ahead. 

But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. "
In what ways is Singapore at the forefront of adult education and training compared to other countries?,"Singapore's adult education and training system has made significant strides in recent years. While there are still areas for improvement, the country has taken a proactive approach to addressing the needs of its workforce. One key aspect of this is the emphasis on providing opportunities for mid-career workers to upskill and reskill through the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme. This initiative aims to support workers who may not have had access to formal education or training earlier in their careers, but are now looking to enhance their skills to remain competitive in the job market.

Another area where Singapore is making a notable impact is in its investment in vocational training and apprenticeships. The government has recognized the importance of providing practical, hands-on experience for workers, and has taken steps to increase funding and support for these types of programs. This approach acknowledges that many workers may not have the time or resources to pursue traditional academic pathways, but still want to acquire new skills and knowledge.

Overall, Singapore's commitment to adult education and training is focused on providing flexible, accessible, and effective solutions that meet the diverse needs of its workforce. By investing in these areas, the government aims to create a more skilled and adaptable workforce, better equipped to thrive in an ever-changing economy.","As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

To be clear, this is not about Government spending. We are prepared to spend more where necessary.
a. But it's equally, if not more, important to get the policies right.
b. And to ensure the overall system is fiscally sound and sustainable.
43. And on that basis, we have been taking steps to progressively strengthen the key pillars of our social support and our social compact.
a. We started in Singapore with the basics: universal access to primary school for education; CPF for retirement; government subsidies and the 3Ms for healthcare; and HDB for housing.
b. And we've progressively enhanced these pillars - Workfare for lowerwage workers; Silver Support for the more vulnerable seniors; and SkillsFuture to support all our workers.
44. 

b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

144. 

# Tackling Infrastructure and Resource Constraints 

55. Third, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in worldclass infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints.
56. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods, and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.
a. Development on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.
b. We have achieved islandwide 5G coverage, and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.



65. In most other countries, poor budget marksmanship is when a government severely overestimates the revenue it will collect, and underestimates its expenditure.
a. That's what poor marksmanship is about. That the Government makes unfunded promises that it cannot see through because there is no money; or it borrows funds from somewhere else and kicks the can down the road and leaves behind a growing burden for the next generation. But this is not the case in Singapore, where we practice responsible and prudent budgeting.

b. Ultimately, it is not just a matter of good marksmanship or poor marksmanship. It is a question of the right values and the wrong values; the correct fiscal principles and the wrong fiscal principles.
66. And the WP and the PSP may think that we are being overly cautious in our projections. But this government will never take risks with Singaporeans' lives and future.
a. We keep our public finances healthy year after year.
b. We spend within our means; and if there are new or additional areas of need, we raise revenues to meet these new demands.
c. We always ensure that we have enough rather than risk falling behind and falling short.
d. And should we have surpluses, that's good news. The money is not squandered, because it helps to fund future needs, and allows us to provide more support for Singaporeans. And the fruits of Singapore's progress will be shared with everyone, as we are doing in this Budget to recognise the collective effort of all Singaporeans.
e. Sir, that's the responsible way to steward and manage our nation's finances. We have 60 years of history to show that Singapore has abided by the right values and principles. And Singaporeans can count on this Government to continue doing the same.
67. We are in a fortunate position to have surpluses in FY2024 and FY2025. But on the expenditure side, I fully expect our spending to increase in the coming years.
a. Mr Leong commented that the monies are going into more and more endowment and trust funds, but in fact the majority of these funds are drawdown funds. In other words, the monies within these funds are going to be withdrawn and spent for upcoming needs.

b. Take for example Changi Airport. The monies that we set aside will be spent very soon, as the construction on Terminal 5 begins this year.
c. Changi Airport is owned by the Changi Airport Group (or CAG). It's not directly by the Government. And so the T5 project is not eligible for SINGA borrowing. Instead, CAG will borrow for the project, and the Government will be providing a guarantee to help lower borrowing costs, as I have explained in my Budget Statement. But if we want Changi Airport to remain competitive as a global air hub, CAG cannot rely on borrowing alone to cover the full costs of the project, and that's why the Government is providing significant support and funding through grants.
68. 

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?
"
What challenges does Singapore face in building up the SkillsFuture system?,"Singapore faces a challenge in that many countries have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training. This means that there is a gap between what has been done in formal schooling years and what needs to be done for adult education and training, which is a key component of the SkillsFuture system.","But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.

e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

# Encouraging Lifelong Learning 

70. At last year's Budget, I introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, to support mid-career Singaporeans in getting a significant skills reboot.
a. Under the programme, all Singaporeans aged 40 years and above will get $\$ 4,000$ in SkillsFuture Credit.
b. From next month, individuals can apply for a training allowance of up to $\$ 3,000$ per month for selected full-time courses. They will have 24 months' worth of allowance, which is up to $\$ 72,000$ per worker.
71. 

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

# Supporting our Enterprises in Workforce Transformation 

78. And in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.
79. Companies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to shortterm cost pressures. And we've also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way government agencies administer their support to enterprises.
80. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant.
a. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process.
b. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to $70 \%$ for job redesign activities.

81. In addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.
a. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation.
b. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training, and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.
82. So we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible.
a. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet.
b. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis.

83. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $\mathbf{\$ 1 0 , 0 0 0}$ in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.
84. Meanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.

# I. Conclusion 

180. Mr Speaker, 60 years in Chinese culture marks a full cycle of life. So in this SG60 year, we will complete one cycle, and we will enter a new phase of nation-building.
181. We must brace ourselves for new challenges in this next phase. There are dark clouds over the horizon. The world is in turmoil, and the situation is likely to get worse in the coming years.
182. But this is not the first time that Singapore has had to confront tough external circumstances. We've done so repeatedly over the last six decades, and so we can draw confidence from what we've been through together.

# E. Conclusion

79. Mr Speaker, to conclude, the world is going through unprecedented changes. We are contending with tectonic shifts on multiple fronts - geopolitics and trade, technology and energy, demographics and culture.
80. Thriving amidst adversity is never easy but that's what the Singapore story is all about, from the very beginning. And we have strong foundations today that give us the confidence to move forward:
a. We have a strong fiscal footing, built up over years of careful stewardship by our forefathers.
b. We have a clear plan for the road ahead, anchored on our Forward Singapore agenda.
c. We are grounded in our shared values of solidarity and unity.
81. This year's Budget paves the way for us to chart Singapore's next lap - to navigate uncertainties with gumption and strength, to address immediate challenges decisively, and to secure our long-term future with confidence. It is a Budget put together by Singaporeans, with Singaporeans, for all Singaporeans.
82. So let us write the next chapter of our Singapore story and move onward together for a better tomorrow.

69. Al will get better in the future, and other new disruptive technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant. That's why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning, and have made significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our social compact.

91. Even with reskilling and upskilling, some workers may face career setbacks due to economic and business disruptions.
92. We will help workers who lose their jobs to get back on their feet through the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, which will start from April this year. The scheme will provide financial support of up to $\$ 6,000$ over six months, to give our workers assurance as they undergo training or search for jobs.

71. 

102. There's still much more to do in the years ahead. We will:
a. Upgrade our homes and estates;
b. Refresh and rejuvenate our landscape and infrastructure; and
c. Importantly, prepare for a future of rising global temperatures.
103. Addressing the climate crisis requires strong international collaboration and collective action.
a. Unfortunately, momentum on global climate efforts has slowed.
b. This will make it harder for all of us to tackle climate change.

c. Despite these challenges, we remain resolute in our commitment to decarbonisation.
104. We will work with international partners and do our part to sustain efforts and drive meaningful progress.
a. Just a week ago, we submitted our new climate target to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
b. We have committed to reducing our emissions to between 45 to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035.
c. This will bring us one step closer to realising our longer-term aim of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

And in this year's Budget, I will take further steps towards these goals.

To be clear, this is not about Government spending. We are prepared to spend more where necessary.
a. But it's equally, if not more, important to get the policies right.
b. And to ensure the overall system is fiscally sound and sustainable.
43. And on that basis, we have been taking steps to progressively strengthen the key pillars of our social support and our social compact.
a. We started in Singapore with the basics: universal access to primary school for education; CPF for retirement; government subsidies and the 3Ms for healthcare; and HDB for housing.
b. And we've progressively enhanced these pillars - Workfare for lowerwage workers; Silver Support for the more vulnerable seniors; and SkillsFuture to support all our workers.
44. "
How does the government plan to create more opportunities and better jobs for Singaporeans?,"The government plans to create more opportunities and better jobs for Singaporeans by taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture. This includes putting in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture, as well as experimenting, innovating, and finding their own way forward since there are no ready models to look to internationally.","This is what economic dynamism and growth can deliver for our people. And so we will keep our economy strong and vibrant, and ensure that there are even more opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans - both now and in the future.

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.
21. 

But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

Over the decades, we can see how Singapore's economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.
a. In the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas.
b. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse.

c. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, IT, biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness.
d. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.
66. 

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


# Creating Good Jobs 

18. With constant industry transformation, we can expect more churn in workplaces - existing jobs will be re-designed and new jobs will be created. Understandably, all this will contribute to anxiety and concerns amongst Singaporeans about jobs. Several MPs like Ms Cheryl Chan and Mr Faisal Manap spoke about this, and Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan also

highlighted the disruptions that could be posed by rapid technological advances.
a. These concerns are real, and I acknowledge them.


49. We keep an open mind and study all suggestions carefully.
a. And beyond ideas shared in this house, we continue to engage widely to hear views from all Singaporeans.
b. We do so through participatory platforms, something that Ms He Ting Ru spoke about, like citizen panels, youth panels, and alliances for action. These platforms are resource-intensive. They take a lot of time, but we find them useful, and we will plan to do more.
c. We may not be able to do implement every idea; there will be difference of views. And if we can't implement for whatever reason, we will explain why.
50. Our commitment, the Government's commitment, is that we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that every Singaporean feels supported at every life stage.
a. And the numbers, what we spend on, reflects this commitment. In fact, we spend more on social development than on the economy and security. Actually, social spending is already greater than what we spend on both the economy and security combined. So we are not saying we will do. We have done so in concrete terms.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
b. And we expect social spending to continue to grow in the coming years.
c. It's partly driven by our ageing population and rising healthcare costs.
d. It's also because of our efforts under Forward Singapore to strengthen our social compact. We have fleshed out many programmes in this Budget and the previous one. But as I said there will be more to come, as this is a multi-year effort.


We will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC's e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints islandwide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes, and prepare them for interviews.
94. Besides nationwide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.
a. Today, North East CDC runs Job Placement Centres for its district, in partnership with WSG. The centres have yielded meaningful outcomes.

b. We will expand localised job matching to all CDCs across the island.
95. We will also strengthen our support for two groups of workers in this Budget - seniors and ex-offenders.
96. More seniors are staying employed as our population ages. We want to work with employers to tap on the experience and wisdom of seniors who are able and wish to continue working.
a. In the immediate term, I will extend the Senior Employment

Credit (or SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $\$ 4,000$ a month.
b. In line with the increase in the re-employment age, I will raise the qualifying age for the highest SEC wage support tier to 69 years old, from 68 years old today. The Government will reimburse companies up to $7 \%$ of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.

97. Later this year, MOM will convene a Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment. The workgroup will undertake a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies, to improve the employability of seniors, and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.
98. In line with the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, we will proceed with the next step of planned CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers. We will increase the CPF contribution rates for those aged above 55 to 65 by 1.5 percentage points in 2026.
a. We will also continue to provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2026.
b. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost.


While our revenues have increased, we have also spent more on Singaporeans. For example, we provided $\$ 3$ billion in MediSave top-ups in December last year, which will help to cushion the increase in MediShield Life premiums to fund better coverage and higher payouts.
172. We also earmarked resources for projects to boost economic competitiveness, including developing critical infrastructure like Changi Terminal 5, and for the energy transition.
173. Overall, I expect to end FY2024 with a surplus of $\$ 6.4$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.
174. For FY2025, I expect a similar fiscal position, with a surplus of $\$ 6.8$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP."
What are the global factors that have driven inflation in Singapore?,"Wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.","# B. Tackling Cost Pressures 

19. Let me start by addressing concerns over rising costs, for both individuals and businesses.
20. Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.


e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.
27. 

# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
9. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

# C. Advancing our Growth Frontier 

32. We will take bold and decisive actions to advance our growth frontier.
33. The Singapore economy now operates at a higher level. But we cannot afford to stand still. Global economic competition is intensifying. And many other countries and cities are pressing ahead. If we fail to stay competitive, we will be left behind. We must therefore redouble efforts to grow our economy, and keep it dynamic and vibrant.
34. Growth has a direct impact on the collective wellbeing of Singaporeans.
a. Last year, our economy grew by more than $4 \%$. 

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

# E. Conclusion

79. Mr Speaker, to conclude, the world is going through unprecedented changes. We are contending with tectonic shifts on multiple fronts - geopolitics and trade, technology and energy, demographics and culture.
80. Thriving amidst adversity is never easy but that's what the Singapore story is all about, from the very beginning. And we have strong foundations today that give us the confidence to move forward:
a. We have a strong fiscal footing, built up over years of careful stewardship by our forefathers.
b. We have a clear plan for the road ahead, anchored on our Forward Singapore agenda.
c. We are grounded in our shared values of solidarity and unity.
81. This year's Budget paves the way for us to chart Singapore's next lap - to navigate uncertainties with gumption and strength, to address immediate challenges decisively, and to secure our long-term future with confidence. It is a Budget put together by Singaporeans, with Singaporeans, for all Singaporeans.
82. So let us write the next chapter of our Singapore story and move onward together for a better tomorrow.
83. 

# A. Introduction 

Mr Speaker, Sir

1. I move that Parliament approve the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.
2. 2025 marks our $60^{\text {th }}$ year of independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.
3. 60 years ago, the world was very different:
a. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States and the Soviet Union.
b. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

4. As a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges.
a. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant.
b. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy.
c. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.
5. Yet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation.
a. We refused to be pawns in someone else's game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength.
b. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy.
c. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.

6. Today, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected - not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers.
7. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.
8. 

30. As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.
a. That remains the key thrust of our approach.
b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.
c. Singaporean households - across different income levels - have experienced sustained real income growth over the past decade. And

what we have achieved has outperformed many other advanced economies, as you can see from this chart.

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


## Budget Debate Round Up Speech"
How did the GST increase affect inflation in Singapore according to the context?,"The GST increase did not have a direct impact on inflation in Singapore as forecasted by economists. In fact, the actual inflation rate was higher than expected, indicating that the GST increase may not have had the moderating effect anticipated.

However, it's worth noting that the forecasters were predicting a decrease in inflation due to the increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate, which would lead to increased costs for businesses and potentially moderate inflation.","# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


# B. Tackling Cost Pressures 

19. Let me start by addressing concerns over rising costs, for both individuals and businesses.
20. Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.


It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect. The higher collections were a result of Government action by injecting additional COE quota. This helped to bring prices down by 10 to $30 \%$ from the peaks in Oct 2023. But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.
27. 

21. That's why we have been providing additional support measures over the last two years to cushion the impact on Singaporeans.
a. Last year, I enhanced the Assurance Package by $\$ 1.9$ billion.
b. The Package has helped to fully offset the effects of inflation for lower-income households, and to provide a significant cushion for middle-income households.

22. We will continue to provide support for as long as needed, within our means. While inflation is expected to ease further this year, prices remain high. Singaporeans are still adjusting to these new price realities. Some have had to tighten their belts, rethink spending habits, or make difficult trade-offs to manage their expenses.
23. Therefore, in this Budget, I will provide additional support for Singaporeans.
a. First, I will provide $\$ 800$ in CDC Vouchers to every Singaporean household.
i. The first $\$ 500$ will be disbursed in May this year. And the remaining $\$ 300$ will be disbursed in January next year.
ii. As with previous CDC Vouchers, half can be used at participating supermarkets. And the other half can be used at participating heartland merchants and hawkers.

## Building A Fairer and More Resilient Tax System

163. In this term of government, we've made several significant changes to our tax system. These revenue moves give us the resources we need to meet our spending needs, and also make our fiscal system more progressive.
164. The GST rate increase ensures we have the revenues to look after our growing number of seniors, even with rising healthcare costs.

a. Through the Assurance Package, we have cushioned and delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households.
b. Importantly, we have designed our GST system with permanent GST vouchers. This ensures that lower-income households pay a far lower effective GST rate than higherincome households.
165. We also continue to ensure fairness and improve progressivity in our tax system. This means that those who are better off will pay more in taxes to help their fellow citizens.
166. That's why we raised Property Tax rates for all non-owneroccupied residential properties, which are mainly investment properties, as well as for higher-value owner-occupied residential properties.
a. The Property Tax rate changes coincided with a sharp increase in the Annual Values of properties, which arose because of Covid-19-related supply constraints in the property market.

b. We have therefore revised and updated the Annual Value bands of owner-occupier Property Tax rates for residential properties. And that means that more homes now fall within bands with lower tax rates.
c. To further cushion the impact, we provided Property Tax rebates. In November last year, we announced another rebate of up to 20\% for owner-occupied residential properties in 2025, capped at \$1,000.
d. Taken together, all HDB owner-occupiers and over 90\% of private residential property owner-occupiers will see lower Property Taxes this year.
167. 

But if we were to rewind the clock, and consider our situation, imagine what our situation was at the beginning of this decade.
a. We were in the thick of battle, fighting COVID.
b. I know it feels like a bad dream and a distant memory to all of us, but those were truly tough times. In 2020 alone, we had five budgets. In 2021 we had three budgets. We sought the President's approval five times to draw from Past Reserves.
c. And this is 2020, 2021. We had no way of knowing when the pandemic would end, how the virus would mutate, how many more new waves of infection we would face, how many more restrictions we have to impose, and how much deeper a fiscal hole we would end up with.
d. But we already knew for sure that spending needs would rise over the horizon. It was coming, year after year. Healthcare spending was rising,

especially with our rapidly ageing population.
e. We looked at different ways to raise revenues including through property and income taxes. But these moves were still not enough to cover the expected increase in expenditure, which was sure to happen.
59. So what should we do to plug the funding gap?
a. That's why we had to consider the GST increase.
b. It was a difficult decision. It was a difficult choice - it's never easy to raise taxes, and certainly not a tax like the GST.
c. But governance is about making responsible choices, not just popular ones. We must ask ourselves: Do we want short-term populism or longterm stability? Do we want to kick the can down the road or take the hard but necessary decisions?
60. So once there were signs that the economy had stabilised, we decided to proceed with the GST increase.
a. But we also rolled out a comprehensive Assurance Package, which effectively delayed the GST increase for the vast majority of Singaporean households.
b. Essentially, once we decided to move, the GST rates were locked in. But with the Assurance Package, we could be more responsive to changing circumstances. And we could push back effectively the impact of the GST increase.
c. And that's exactly what we did. We had multiple rounds of enhancements to the Assurance Package - to tackle cost-of-living concerns, and to ensure that the majority of households will not feel the impact of the additional GST for at least 5 years.

d. At the same time, we have a permanent GST Voucher, which we also enhanced, and this ensures that the GST and GST Voucher scheme, combined together, will support the lower-income groups and will protect them - not just over the next five or 10 years, but on a permanent and ongoing basis.
61. So with that in place, together with the other revenue moves we made, we are in a better position now. And now, the additional GST revenues have started to come in - and it's mostly, the revenues are mostly from those who are better-off, foreigners, as well as tourists. And it will give us the resources we need to improve our healthcare infrastructure, and take better care of our seniors.
62. What would have happened if we chose to avoid the GST increase because it is unpopular? Or if we did not enjoy the unexpected upsides in corporate income tax collections, which only emerged in the last two years?
a. We would have ended FY2024 in a deficit.
b. The projected balance in FY2025 would also have been a deficit.
c. And that would have meant less funding for essential services, less support for our seniors, and fewer resources to invest in our future.
d. Basically, Singapore and Singaporeans would have ended up in a much weaker position.
63. Several Members I know criticised MOF's fiscal marksmanship.
64. Look, when I started work in MOF decades ago, one of my main tasks was to provide fiscal projections. As an economist, that was what I did. I was one of those who would run the models, and churn out the figures. So I know exactly what this work entails and how difficult it is.
a. I will not defend the figures if they are off the mark.

b. But I will speak up for our MOF officers who do this work with dedication and professionalism against any unfair criticisms.
65. Ultimately, a budget is a projection - it is based on the best available information at that point in time.
a. We have to plan ahead. 

We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.

Our solidarity has seen us through many challenges, including our fight against Covid-19. We must continue to help our fellow citizens, and ensure we move forward together, as a people and a nation.

156. To encourage this spirit of giving, the Government provides matching funds that multiply the impact of donations. This year, we will increase our support for the fund-raising efforts of charities and social causes.
a. We will provide a $\$ 100$ million top-up to the Cultural

Matching Fund and extend it for five years until the end of Financial Year 2029.
b. The Government and Tote Board now provide dollar-fordollar matching grants for the fund-raising projects of Singapore-registered charities. We will provide a $\$ 270$ million top-up to this Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme, which will be extended for three years until the end of Financial Year 2027.

c. Many Singaporeans are passionate about social causes but may not have a specific charity in mind. The Community Chest, the Collective for a Stronger Society, and the President's Challenge provide platforms that help donors contribute to a range of programmes. We will introduce a \$250 million SG Gives matching grant to provide dollar-fordollar matching for donations made through these platforms. And to encourage sustained giving amongst larger donors, we will provide a higher $\$ 1.50$ in matching for donations with a minimum three-year commitment of at least $\$ 250,000$ per year.
d. In total, the Government and Tote Board will set aside more than $\$ 600$ million in matching funds to strengthen our spirit of giving.
157. Earlier, I had shared about the SG60 Vouchers. Those who are better off may want to donate their vouchers to those with greater needs. We will facilitate this, and we will share more on how to do so in due course.



30. As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.
a. That remains the key thrust of our approach.
b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.
c. Singaporean households - across different income levels - have experienced sustained real income growth over the past decade. And

what we have achieved has outperformed many other advanced economies, as you can see from this chart.

How do high price levels create real pressures for people?,"Price levels that remain high despite eased inflation can create real pressures because they lead to sustained cost increases. This can be particularly challenging for individuals and businesses as it takes time for them to adjust to these new price realities, leading to ongoing financial strain.","# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.
27. 

# B. Tackling Cost Pressures 

19. Let me start by addressing concerns over rising costs, for both individuals and businesses.
20. Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.


# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect. The higher collections were a result of Government action by injecting additional COE quota. This helped to bring prices down by 10 to $30 \%$ from the peaks in Oct 2023. But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


Members have offered many suggestions. Ms Hazel Poa said we need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations, and that we are overly reliant on the price mechanism, citing land as an example.
35. But pricing all resources properly is not about giving more weight to economic over social considerations; it's simply about getting our policies right and doing things the right way.
a. If we don't price properly, then we are giving a hidden subsidy.
b. A subsidy means someone has to pay. If it's not paid by consumers, it's paid by taxpayers. If it's not paid today, it will have to be paid tomorrow.
c. Because at the end of the day, there is no free lunch.
36. So our approach must be to get the price right. Then we decide how much to subsidise.
a. Take public housing as an example.
b. HDB has to pay the market price for the land when it develops a new flat.
c. But when it prices the new flat for sale, it doesn't recover fully the cost of the flat; instead, it prices it on the basis of affordability as we have said time and again.

d. I give you a concrete example. A 4-room BTO flat in Sengkang. This was in the October 2024 BTO exercise.
e. After accounting for grants, a resale flat nearby in that area is around $\$ 545,000$. Five years ago, it was about \$360,000Resale prices have gone up nearly $\$ 200,000$.
f. What about the sales price by HDB for a new flat? The BTO price has not gone up by that much. Instead, it has increased in line with median income over that period, and was sold at about $\$ 370,000$.
g. So resale prices have gone up a lot. BTO, yes, but not as much, and in line with median incomes.
h. The difference is a subsidy borne by the government.
i. That, together with the higher cost of construction, that is one of the key reasons why HDB's deficit has increased sharply. If you look at its annual statements, in FY2018 the deficit was $\$ 2$ billion. Now in FY2023 it's $\$ 6.8$ billion. And the Government's funding to HDB to cover its deficit has correspondingly increased over the years, to cover the deficit.

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.

The measures we have taken in recent years, and are taking in this Budget, will help to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
31. But in the longer term, the best way to adjust to higher prices is to grow the economy and increase productivity, so that all Singaporeans can enjoy higher real incomes and better standards of living. And let me turn to our strategies next in these areas.

This is not a cost-of-living support. It's an effort to encourage everyone to do their part to be more energy efficient.

20. Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.


D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

Even as spending goes up, we will continue to keep within our means, and maintain a balanced budget over the medium term.
a. And that's why I don't see us being able to put back the amount we had drawn from Past Reserves during COVID (something which Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about).
b. But we will continue to be responsible and prudent with our finances.
c. And if we maintain this approach, our reserves should be able to keep pace with our economy, and we can continue to benefit from a steady stream of NIRC in our revenue stream.
69. Compare this with the fiscal situation in so many other advanced economies around the world, especially in the West.
a. They are running record levels of fiscal deficits; and their national debts are growing faster than their economies.
b. So the fiscal space they have to sustain their higher levels of welfare, while continuing to invest in defence and the economy, is shrinking.
c. And at some point, the reckoning will come.



It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect.

But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


Some of you may ask, and this is the right question to ask, is this sustainable?
a. It will not be sustainable if overall property prices keep rising faster than incomes, and the financing gap keeps growing year after year.
b. But this will not happen because we keep a close watch over the property market, and we ensure it does not happen.
c. That's why we have introduced cooling measures where necessary by increasing the ABSD for multiple property and foreigner purchases. And

we have significantly increased BTO supply as well as Government Land Sales to make up for the disruption that occurred during COVID.
d. And these measures have helped and will eventually stabilise the market.


We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.


# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



21. That's why we have been providing additional support measures over the last two years to cushion the impact on Singaporeans.
a. Last year, I enhanced the Assurance Package by $\$ 1.9$ billion.
b. The Package has helped to fully offset the effects of inflation for lower-income households, and to provide a significant cushion for middle-income households.

22. We will continue to provide support for as long as needed, within our means. While inflation is expected to ease further this year, prices remain high. Singaporeans are still adjusting to these new price realities. Some have had to tighten their belts, rethink spending habits, or make difficult trade-offs to manage their expenses.
23. Therefore, in this Budget, I will provide additional support for Singaporeans.
a. First, I will provide $\$ 800$ in CDC Vouchers to every Singaporean household.
i. The first $\$ 500$ will be disbursed in May this year. And the remaining $\$ 300$ will be disbursed in January next year.
ii. As with previous CDC Vouchers, half can be used at participating supermarkets. And the other half can be used at participating heartland merchants and hawkers.

Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.
iii.

## d. Every Singaporean aged 13 to 20 this year will also receive a $\$ 500$ top-up to their Edusave account, or their Post-

Secondary Education Account. They can use this top-up to pay for their approved education-related expenses.

24. More support will be extended to individuals and families who face greater financial stress.
a. We will increase the rates for the ComCare Assistance schemes, to better support lower-income households with basic living expenses. For example, a 1-person household on Long-Term Assistance will receive an additional $\$ 120$ each month, bringing the monthly cash assistance to $\$ 760$. Those supported by Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance will also receive more than before, based on the household's composition, needs, and income.
b. In tandem, we will increase the Singapore Allowance, which is an ex-gratia payment that some of our pensioners receive. It will increase from $\$ 350$ to $\$ 390$ each month, to support those with smaller pensions. And the monthly pension ceiling will also increase to $\$ 1,320$.
c. Through the ComCare Interim Assistance scheme, we will also provide more support for community organisations as well, to help households in need.

25. 

Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


b. There are also first-timer families with children living in public rental flats. They typically face more significant challenges in life, like coping with medical issues in the family, or raising children as a single parent. Hence, they may have difficulties buying a flat with a full 99-year lease, even as first-timers.
c. To support these families in their home ownership journey, we will allow them to buy shorter-lease subsidised flats through Fresh Start.
d. And the Minister for National Development will share more at COS.

The measures we have taken in recent years, and are taking in this Budget, will help to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
31. But in the longer term, the best way to adjust to higher prices is to grow the economy and increase productivity, so that all Singaporeans can enjoy higher real incomes and better standards of living. And let me turn to our strategies next in these areas.

We will also keep an eye on costs, and provide short-term help to companies where needed, but without blunting the incentive for them to restructure.
a. And that's why we have Corporate Income Tax rebates in this Budget.
b. And we are increasing co-funding levels for the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to help companies co-pay the wage increases for lower-wage workers.

c. We are also supporting companies on the regulatory front. DPM Gan Kim Yong is leading the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, to review our regulatory processes and cut compliance costs. And he will give an update on this work at MTI's COS.


133. Many seniors prefer to age in place as much as possible, supported by their families and friends. They can opt for a range of care options. Some may use care services like day care or home care, while others rely primarily on family caregiving. We will also enhance support across the entire spectrum.
a. We will increase existing subsidies for long-term care services in the home and community by up to 10 percentage points, and similarly raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income to $\$ 4,800$.
b. And we will similarly introduce additional subsidies for cohorts born in 1969 and earlier by 15 percentage points.

c. We will also increase the subsidies provided under the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund to cover the rising costs of home healthcare items, like adult diapers, and to also cover additional categories of such items.
134. To better support those who are looking after seniors at home, we will enhance the Home Caregiving Grant. This is a cash grant which can be used to offset daily care costs.
a. We will raise the quantum for the Home Caregiving Grant. The maximum grant will increase to $\$ 600$ per month, from $\$ 400$ today.
b. We will also raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for the Home Caregiving Grant to $\$ 4,800$, so that more caregivers receive support.
135. We expect at least 80,000 seniors to benefit from the enhanced long-term care subsidies and grants, which will be implemented from next year. The enhancements are expected to cost around $\$ 300$ million in FY2026, and more in future years, as our population continues to age.

136. Besides higher subsidies, insurance will also play a part in easing the cost burden of long-term care. With a rapidly ageing population, we have to work hard to manage the increase in longterm care costs, and ensure a good mix of funding support between individual co-payment, government subsidies and insurance. We are studying this issue carefully, and the Minister for Health will say more at COS.

Higher prices also affect our businesses, many of whom are grappling with the higher costs of rent and labour.

28. So I will introduce a 50\% Corporate Income Tax rebate in the Year of Assessment 2025.
a. Not all companies are profitable, and some may not benefit from such a rebate. So, I will provide every active company that employed at least one local employee last year a minimum benefit of $\$ 2,000$.
b. The total benefit that each company will receive will be capped at $\$ 40,000$.
29. Despite facing higher cost pressures, I'm glad that many businesses remain committed to uplifting the wages of lower-wage workers.
a. The Government will continue to share this responsibility with employers.
b. And taking into account feedback from employers, I will enhance the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, by increasing the Government's co-funding levels for wage increases from $30 \%$ in 2025 to $40 \%$, and from $15 \%$ in 2026 to $20 \%$.

30. "
What measures has the Singapore government taken to help citizens cope with inflation?,"The Singapore government has taken several measures to help citizens cope with inflation. These include providing additional support through the Assurance Package, which includes a $\$1.9$ billion enhancement last year and additional U-Save rebates this financial year. Eligible households will receive up to $\$760$ in U-Save rebates, covering about six months of utilities expenses for those living in 1and 2-room flats, and three months of utilities expenses for those living in 3- and 4-room flats.","# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


21. That's why we have been providing additional support measures over the last two years to cushion the impact on Singaporeans.
a. Last year, I enhanced the Assurance Package by $\$ 1.9$ billion.
b. The Package has helped to fully offset the effects of inflation for lower-income households, and to provide a significant cushion for middle-income households.

22. We will continue to provide support for as long as needed, within our means. While inflation is expected to ease further this year, prices remain high. Singaporeans are still adjusting to these new price realities. Some have had to tighten their belts, rethink spending habits, or make difficult trade-offs to manage their expenses.
23. Therefore, in this Budget, I will provide additional support for Singaporeans.
a. First, I will provide $\$ 800$ in CDC Vouchers to every Singaporean household.
i. The first $\$ 500$ will be disbursed in May this year. And the remaining $\$ 300$ will be disbursed in January next year.
ii. As with previous CDC Vouchers, half can be used at participating supermarkets. And the other half can be used at participating heartland merchants and hawkers.

27. 

# B. Tackling Cost Pressures 

19. Let me start by addressing concerns over rising costs, for both individuals and businesses.
20. Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.


We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.


## d. Every Singaporean aged 13 to 20 this year will also receive a $\$ 500$ top-up to their Edusave account, or their Post-

Secondary Education Account. They can use this top-up to pay for their approved education-related expenses.

24. More support will be extended to individuals and families who face greater financial stress.
a. We will increase the rates for the ComCare Assistance schemes, to better support lower-income households with basic living expenses. For example, a 1-person household on Long-Term Assistance will receive an additional $\$ 120$ each month, bringing the monthly cash assistance to $\$ 760$. Those supported by Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance will also receive more than before, based on the household's composition, needs, and income.
b. In tandem, we will increase the Singapore Allowance, which is an ex-gratia payment that some of our pensioners receive. It will increase from $\$ 350$ to $\$ 390$ each month, to support those with smaller pensions. And the monthly pension ceiling will also increase to $\$ 1,320$.
c. Through the ComCare Interim Assistance scheme, we will also provide more support for community organisations as well, to help households in need.

25. 

We achieve this by living within our means, and running a balanced budget over each term of government. This means spending prudently to meet our immediate and future needs, ensuring that our revenues cover expenditures, and keeping the tax burden as low as we can, while not burdening Singaporeans with debt.

Our solidarity has seen us through many challenges, including our fight against Covid-19. We must continue to help our fellow citizens, and ensure we move forward together, as a people and a nation.

156. To encourage this spirit of giving, the Government provides matching funds that multiply the impact of donations. This year, we will increase our support for the fund-raising efforts of charities and social causes.
a. We will provide a $\$ 100$ million top-up to the Cultural

Matching Fund and extend it for five years until the end of Financial Year 2029.
b. The Government and Tote Board now provide dollar-fordollar matching grants for the fund-raising projects of Singapore-registered charities. We will provide a $\$ 270$ million top-up to this Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme, which will be extended for three years until the end of Financial Year 2027.

c. Many Singaporeans are passionate about social causes but may not have a specific charity in mind. The Community Chest, the Collective for a Stronger Society, and the President's Challenge provide platforms that help donors contribute to a range of programmes. We will introduce a \$250 million SG Gives matching grant to provide dollar-fordollar matching for donations made through these platforms. And to encourage sustained giving amongst larger donors, we will provide a higher $\$ 1.50$ in matching for donations with a minimum three-year commitment of at least $\$ 250,000$ per year.
d. In total, the Government and Tote Board will set aside more than $\$ 600$ million in matching funds to strengthen our spirit of giving.
157. Earlier, I had shared about the SG60 Vouchers. Those who are better off may want to donate their vouchers to those with greater needs. We will facilitate this, and we will share more on how to do so in due course.

!

The measures we have taken in recent years, and are taking in this Budget, will help to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
31. But in the longer term, the best way to adjust to higher prices is to grow the economy and increase productivity, so that all Singaporeans can enjoy higher real incomes and better standards of living. And let me turn to our strategies next in these areas."
What is 'vibecession' and how does it relate to the current economic sentiment in the US?,"The term ""vibecession"" refers to a phenomenon where positive headline economic indicators coexist with poor sentiments among the general public. This suggests that despite outward appearances of economic stability or growth, underlying concerns about cost pressures and inflation remain.","e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.

27. 

# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect. The higher collections were a result of Government action by injecting additional COE quota. This helped to bring prices down by 10 to $30 \%$ from the peaks in Oct 2023. But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

This is what economic dynamism and growth can deliver for our people. And so we will keep our economy strong and vibrant, and ensure that there are even more opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans - both now and in the future.

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. 

This is not a cost-of-living support. It's an effort to encourage everyone to do their part to be more energy efficient.
74. 

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


All this has given us good momentum for our next phase.

10. But we expect greater global uncertainty and downside risks.
a. The US and China are locked in a fierce contest for global supremacy.
b. Neither side wants to come to blows. But both know that economic heft and technological prowess are key to winning this global race.
c. And both are prepared to take more assertive actions to advance their own interests, even at the expense of established international norms.
d. So we can expect escalating attempts at containment and counter-containment, with ripple effects that will inevitably draw in other countries, including Singapore.
11. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.
12. For 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook. Growth is projected at $1 \%$ to $3 \%$, while inflation is expected to average $1.5 \%$ to $2.5 \%$.

13. 

# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.

But if we were to rewind the clock, and consider our situation, imagine what our situation was at the beginning of this decade.
a. We were in the thick of battle, fighting COVID.
b. I know it feels like a bad dream and a distant memory to all of us, but those were truly tough times. In 2020 alone, we had five budgets. In 2021 we had three budgets. We sought the President's approval five times to draw from Past Reserves.
c. And this is 2020, 2021. We had no way of knowing when the pandemic would end, how the virus would mutate, how many more new waves of infection we would face, how many more restrictions we have to impose, and how much deeper a fiscal hole we would end up with.
d. But we already knew for sure that spending needs would rise over the horizon. It was coming, year after year. Healthcare spending was rising,

especially with our rapidly ageing population.
e. We looked at different ways to raise revenues including through property and income taxes. But these moves were still not enough to cover the expected increase in expenditure, which was sure to happen.
59. So what should we do to plug the funding gap?
a. That's why we had to consider the GST increase.
b. It was a difficult decision. It was a difficult choice - it's never easy to raise taxes, and certainly not a tax like the GST.
c. But governance is about making responsible choices, not just popular ones. We must ask ourselves: Do we want short-term populism or longterm stability? Do we want to kick the can down the road or take the hard but necessary decisions?
60. So once there were signs that the economy had stabilised, we decided to proceed with the GST increase.
a. But we also rolled out a comprehensive Assurance Package, which effectively delayed the GST increase for the vast majority of Singaporean households.
b. Essentially, once we decided to move, the GST rates were locked in. But with the Assurance Package, we could be more responsive to changing circumstances. And we could push back effectively the impact of the GST increase.
c. And that's exactly what we did. We had multiple rounds of enhancements to the Assurance Package - to tackle cost-of-living concerns, and to ensure that the majority of households will not feel the impact of the additional GST for at least 5 years.

d. At the same time, we have a permanent GST Voucher, which we also enhanced, and this ensures that the GST and GST Voucher scheme, combined together, will support the lower-income groups and will protect them - not just over the next five or 10 years, but on a permanent and ongoing basis.
61. So with that in place, together with the other revenue moves we made, we are in a better position now. And now, the additional GST revenues have started to come in - and it's mostly, the revenues are mostly from those who are better-off, foreigners, as well as tourists. And it will give us the resources we need to improve our healthcare infrastructure, and take better care of our seniors.
62. What would have happened if we chose to avoid the GST increase because it is unpopular? Or if we did not enjoy the unexpected upsides in corporate income tax collections, which only emerged in the last two years?
a. We would have ended FY2024 in a deficit.
b. The projected balance in FY2025 would also have been a deficit.
c. And that would have meant less funding for essential services, less support for our seniors, and fewer resources to invest in our future.
d. Basically, Singapore and Singaporeans would have ended up in a much weaker position.
63. Several Members I know criticised MOF's fiscal marksmanship.
64. Look, when I started work in MOF decades ago, one of my main tasks was to provide fiscal projections. As an economist, that was what I did. I was one of those who would run the models, and churn out the figures. So I know exactly what this work entails and how difficult it is.
a. I will not defend the figures if they are off the mark.

b. But I will speak up for our MOF officers who do this work with dedication and professionalism against any unfair criticisms.
65. Ultimately, a budget is a projection - it is based on the best available information at that point in time.
a. We have to plan ahead. 

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech"
What was the trend in CPI inflation in Singapore from 2022 to 2024?,"CPI inflation moderated to 6.1% in 2022, then came down further to 4.8% in 2023, and finally decreased to 2.4% in 2024.","# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?

20. Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.


While our revenues have increased, we have also spent more on Singaporeans. For example, we provided $\$ 3$ billion in MediSave top-ups in December last year, which will help to cushion the increase in MediShield Life premiums to fund better coverage and higher payouts.
172. We also earmarked resources for projects to boost economic competitiveness, including developing critical infrastructure like Changi Terminal 5, and for the energy transition.
173. Overall, I expect to end FY2024 with a surplus of $\$ 6.4$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.
174. For FY2025, I expect a similar fiscal position, with a surplus of $\$ 6.8$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.

We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.

## Building A Fairer and More Resilient Tax System

163. In this term of government, we've made several significant changes to our tax system. These revenue moves give us the resources we need to meet our spending needs, and also make our fiscal system more progressive.
164. The GST rate increase ensures we have the revenues to look after our growing number of seniors, even with rising healthcare costs.

a. Through the Assurance Package, we have cushioned and delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households.
b. Importantly, we have designed our GST system with permanent GST vouchers. This ensures that lower-income households pay a far lower effective GST rate than higherincome households.
165. We also continue to ensure fairness and improve progressivity in our tax system. This means that those who are better off will pay more in taxes to help their fellow citizens.
166. That's why we raised Property Tax rates for all non-owneroccupied residential properties, which are mainly investment properties, as well as for higher-value owner-occupied residential properties.
a. The Property Tax rate changes coincided with a sharp increase in the Annual Values of properties, which arose because of Covid-19-related supply constraints in the property market.

b. We have therefore revised and updated the Annual Value bands of owner-occupier Property Tax rates for residential properties. And that means that more homes now fall within bands with lower tax rates.
c. To further cushion the impact, we provided Property Tax rebates. In November last year, we announced another rebate of up to 20\% for owner-occupied residential properties in 2025, capped at \$1,000.
d. Taken together, all HDB owner-occupiers and over 90\% of private residential property owner-occupiers will see lower Property Taxes this year.

163. In this term of government, we've made several significant changes to our tax system. These revenue moves give us the resources we need to meet our spending needs, and also make our fiscal system more progressive.
164. The GST rate increase ensures we have the revenues to look after our growing number of seniors, even with rising healthcare costs.

a. Through the Assurance Package, we have cushioned and delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households.
b. Importantly, we have designed our GST system with permanent GST vouchers. This ensures that lower-income households pay a far lower effective GST rate than higherincome households.
165. We also continue to ensure fairness and improve progressivity in our tax system. This means that those who are better off will pay more in taxes to help their fellow citizens.
166. That's why we raised Property Tax rates for all non-owneroccupied residential properties, which are mainly investment properties, as well as for higher-value owner-occupied residential properties.
a. The Property Tax rate changes coincided with a sharp increase in the Annual Values of properties, which arose because of Covid-19-related supply constraints in the property market.

b. We have therefore revised and updated the Annual Value bands of owner-occupier Property Tax rates for residential properties. And that means that more homes now fall within bands with lower tax rates.
c. To further cushion the impact, we provided Property Tax rebates. In November last year, we announced another rebate of up to 20\% for owner-occupied residential properties in 2025, capped at \$1,000.
d. Taken together, all HDB owner-occupiers and over 90\% of private residential property owner-occupiers will see lower Property Taxes this year.

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

65. In most other countries, poor budget marksmanship is when a government severely overestimates the revenue it will collect, and underestimates its expenditure.
a. That's what poor marksmanship is about. That the Government makes unfunded promises that it cannot see through because there is no money; or it borrows funds from somewhere else and kicks the can down the road and leaves behind a growing burden for the next generation. But this is not the case in Singapore, where we practice responsible and prudent budgeting.

b. Ultimately, it is not just a matter of good marksmanship or poor marksmanship. It is a question of the right values and the wrong values; the correct fiscal principles and the wrong fiscal principles.
66. And the WP and the PSP may think that we are being overly cautious in our projections. But this government will never take risks with Singaporeans' lives and future.
a. We keep our public finances healthy year after year.
b. We spend within our means; and if there are new or additional areas of need, we raise revenues to meet these new demands.
c. We always ensure that we have enough rather than risk falling behind and falling short.
d. And should we have surpluses, that's good news. The money is not squandered, because it helps to fund future needs, and allows us to provide more support for Singaporeans. And the fruits of Singapore's progress will be shared with everyone, as we are doing in this Budget to recognise the collective effort of all Singaporeans.
e. Sir, that's the responsible way to steward and manage our nation's finances. We have 60 years of history to show that Singapore has abided by the right values and principles. And Singaporeans can count on this Government to continue doing the same.
67. We are in a fortunate position to have surpluses in FY2024 and FY2025. But on the expenditure side, I fully expect our spending to increase in the coming years.
a. Mr Leong commented that the monies are going into more and more endowment and trust funds, but in fact the majority of these funds are drawdown funds. In other words, the monies within these funds are going to be withdrawn and spent for upcoming needs.

b. Take for example Changi Airport. The monies that we set aside will be spent very soon, as the construction on Terminal 5 begins this year.
c. Changi Airport is owned by the Changi Airport Group (or CAG). It's not directly by the Government. And so the T5 project is not eligible for SINGA borrowing. Instead, CAG will borrow for the project, and the Government will be providing a guarantee to help lower borrowing costs, as I have explained in my Budget Statement. But if we want Changi Airport to remain competitive as a global air hub, CAG cannot rely on borrowing alone to cover the full costs of the project, and that's why the Government is providing significant support and funding through grants.

But more importantly, let's look at the overall picture. We continue to have a highly progressive tax and transfer system.
a. Members are familiar with the benefits and tax ratios, which we highlight every budget. And it's worth going through them again.
b. The bottom quintile of households receives $\$ 4$ in benefits for every dollar of tax paid. Middle-income households also get more benefits than tax paid as you go through the income thresholds and levels.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
c. In fact, it's only the top quintile of income earners receives less in benefits, or 30 cents, for every dollar of tax paid. So this is what our system has achieved.
d. So these outcomes are a culmination of years of deliberate moves to enhance the progressivity of our overall taxes and transfers system.
75. There is no fiscal system in the world that can deliver perfect precision and equity. But I think we have found an approach in Singapore that works for us. It is not perfect, but we continue to make it better.

a. Here, everyone contributes to taxes. The lower and middle-income will receive more support, while the higher-income and wealthier segments of the population will contribute more. It's a fair and progressive tax and redistribution system, anchored on our values of a fair and just society.
b. And the strength of our fiscal system is internationally recognised. A recent OECD report commended Singapore on our robust fiscal system.
c. This is hard-earned credibility that we have built up over many, many decades. It is not something we should take for granted, because that same credibility can be quickly destroyed in the wrong hands.
76. And at the end of the day, something as fundamental as this, Singaporeans will decide.
77. Will they prefer a government that underestimates our needs, spends more from our hard-earned reserves, and leaves us weaker?
78. Or will they prefer a government that is steadfast, that upholds fiscal responsibility and discipline, and ensures we have enough resources for current and future generations to handle unexpected challenges?
a. Sir, the PAP's approach is clear: we take our duty as stewards of the country seriously. We remain true to our mission, and manage our finances carefully for the benefit of all Singaporeans, now and in the future.
b. We will continue to do our best to convince Singaporeans that ours is the right approach - it has served us well these last 60 years, and it will continue to keep Singapore on the right track in the years ahead.

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

## A. Introduction

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

3. The questions raised by Members during this debate revolve around three main issues:
a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

Our solidarity has seen us through many challenges, including our fight against Covid-19. We must continue to help our fellow citizens, and ensure we move forward together, as a people and a nation.

156. To encourage this spirit of giving, the Government provides matching funds that multiply the impact of donations. This year, we will increase our support for the fund-raising efforts of charities and social causes.
a. We will provide a $\$ 100$ million top-up to the Cultural

Matching Fund and extend it for five years until the end of Financial Year 2029.
b. The Government and Tote Board now provide dollar-fordollar matching grants for the fund-raising projects of Singapore-registered charities. We will provide a $\$ 270$ million top-up to this Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme, which will be extended for three years until the end of Financial Year 2027.

c. Many Singaporeans are passionate about social causes but may not have a specific charity in mind. The Community Chest, the Collective for a Stronger Society, and the President's Challenge provide platforms that help donors contribute to a range of programmes. We will introduce a \$250 million SG Gives matching grant to provide dollar-fordollar matching for donations made through these platforms. And to encourage sustained giving amongst larger donors, we will provide a higher $\$ 1.50$ in matching for donations with a minimum three-year commitment of at least $\$ 250,000$ per year.
d. In total, the Government and Tote Board will set aside more than $\$ 600$ million in matching funds to strengthen our spirit of giving.
157. Earlier, I had shared about the SG60 Vouchers. Those who are better off may want to donate their vouchers to those with greater needs. We will facilitate this, and we will share more on how to do so in due course.

"
Why do price levels remain high even though inflation has eased?,Price levels remain high due to the time it takes for people to adjust to new price realities. This adjustment period creates real pressures that cannot be ignored immediately after a decrease in inflation rates.,"e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.
27. 

It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect. The higher collections were a result of Government action by injecting additional COE quota. This helped to bring prices down by 10 to $30 \%$ from the peaks in Oct 2023. But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


Even as spending goes up, we will continue to keep within our means, and maintain a balanced budget over the medium term.
a. And that's why I don't see us being able to put back the amount we had drawn from Past Reserves during COVID (something which Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about).
b. But we will continue to be responsible and prudent with our finances.
c. And if we maintain this approach, our reserves should be able to keep pace with our economy, and we can continue to benefit from a steady stream of NIRC in our revenue stream.
69. Compare this with the fiscal situation in so many other advanced economies around the world, especially in the West.
a. They are running record levels of fiscal deficits; and their national debts are growing faster than their economies.
b. So the fiscal space they have to sustain their higher levels of welfare, while continuing to invest in defence and the economy, is shrinking.
c. And at some point, the reckoning will come.



# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

Some of you may ask, and this is the right question to ask, is this sustainable?
a. It will not be sustainable if overall property prices keep rising faster than incomes, and the financing gap keeps growing year after year.
b. But this will not happen because we keep a close watch over the property market, and we ensure it does not happen.
c. That's why we have introduced cooling measures where necessary by increasing the ABSD for multiple property and foreigner purchases. And

we have significantly increased BTO supply as well as Government Land Sales to make up for the disruption that occurred during COVID.
d. And these measures have helped and will eventually stabilise the market.


We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
9. 

Members have offered many suggestions. Ms Hazel Poa said we need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations, and that we are overly reliant on the price mechanism, citing land as an example.
35. But pricing all resources properly is not about giving more weight to economic over social considerations; it's simply about getting our policies right and doing things the right way.
a. If we don't price properly, then we are giving a hidden subsidy.
b. A subsidy means someone has to pay. If it's not paid by consumers, it's paid by taxpayers. If it's not paid today, it will have to be paid tomorrow.
c. Because at the end of the day, there is no free lunch.
36. So our approach must be to get the price right. Then we decide how much to subsidise.
a. Take public housing as an example.
b. HDB has to pay the market price for the land when it develops a new flat.
c. But when it prices the new flat for sale, it doesn't recover fully the cost of the flat; instead, it prices it on the basis of affordability as we have said time and again.

d. I give you a concrete example. A 4-room BTO flat in Sengkang. This was in the October 2024 BTO exercise.
e. After accounting for grants, a resale flat nearby in that area is around $\$ 545,000$. Five years ago, it was about \$360,000Resale prices have gone up nearly $\$ 200,000$.
f. What about the sales price by HDB for a new flat? The BTO price has not gone up by that much. Instead, it has increased in line with median income over that period, and was sold at about $\$ 370,000$.
g. So resale prices have gone up a lot. BTO, yes, but not as much, and in line with median incomes.
h. The difference is a subsidy borne by the government.
i. That, together with the higher cost of construction, that is one of the key reasons why HDB's deficit has increased sharply. If you look at its annual statements, in FY2018 the deficit was $\$ 2$ billion. Now in FY2023 it's $\$ 6.8$ billion. And the Government's funding to HDB to cover its deficit has correspondingly increased over the years, to cover the deficit.
37. 

21. That's why we have been providing additional support measures over the last two years to cushion the impact on Singaporeans.
a. Last year, I enhanced the Assurance Package by $\$ 1.9$ billion.
b. The Package has helped to fully offset the effects of inflation for lower-income households, and to provide a significant cushion for middle-income households.

22. We will continue to provide support for as long as needed, within our means. While inflation is expected to ease further this year, prices remain high. Singaporeans are still adjusting to these new price realities. Some have had to tighten their belts, rethink spending habits, or make difficult trade-offs to manage their expenses.
23. Therefore, in this Budget, I will provide additional support for Singaporeans.
a. First, I will provide $\$ 800$ in CDC Vouchers to every Singaporean household.
i. The first $\$ 500$ will be disbursed in May this year. And the remaining $\$ 300$ will be disbursed in January next year.
ii. As with previous CDC Vouchers, half can be used at participating supermarkets. And the other half can be used at participating heartland merchants and hawkers.

38. More specifically, when you look at the HDB market - in the short term market, resale prices can be up, and they can be down. In localised popular areas, they will generally be higher than the less popular areas. That's why we introduced a new classification system with the Plus and Prime flats.
39. But overall, in the longer term, we are confident that HDB prices will remain affordable. Why? Because only Singaporeans can buy HDB flats. And we can, and we will build enough housing for every Singaporean household.
40. For now, we have focussed on ensuring that the new flats are available for first-timers, especially young married couples and parents with young children.
a. And we are seeing concrete improvements. The application rate for firsttimer families across all flat types has stabilised: in fact it has come down from 3.7 times in 2019 to 2.1 times in 2024. This is the application rate, so application rates are now below pre-COVID levels.
b. And with a sustained and robust supply of new flats, and as the overall market stabilises, we will have scope to consider how to adjust our policies to meet the needs of other groups, including second-timers and singles.
41. 

# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


# B. Tackling Cost Pressures 

19. Let me start by addressing concerns over rising costs, for both individuals and businesses.
20. Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.
"
What is the current state of inflation globally and in Singapore?,"Global inflation has eased, but price levels remain high. Inflation in Singapore also moderated to 2.4% in 2024, indicating a decrease from previous years.","e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.

c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
9. 

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

30. As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.
a. That remains the key thrust of our approach.
b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.
c. Singaporean households - across different income levels - have experienced sustained real income growth over the past decade. And

what we have achieved has outperformed many other advanced economies, as you can see from this chart.

## Navigating Global Challenges

6. Sir, the entire global system is changing.
a. We see it unfolding in real time before our eyes. The multilateral trading system has been weakened by growing protectionist sentiments and unilateral measures.
b. Countries are focusing more on their defence and security interests. So it's become more about zero-sum competition rather than win-win cooperation.

c. All these will disadvantage small and open economies like Singapore.
7. The major powers say they don't want to fight, they don't want conflict. But they are all preparing for conflict.
a. And all of them realise that there is a need for a strong industrial base to sustain any war effort.
b. In particular, the Western countries feel they are at a disadvantage. "
What percentage of the budget is allocated to cost-of-living measures and the SG60 Package?,5%,"We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.

## Recognising Singaporeans' Contributions

147. In this Budget, I will introduce an SG60 package to recognise the contributions of all Singaporeans, and to share the benefits of our nation's progress.
a. First, I will give SG60 Vouchers to all Singaporeans aged 21 and above this year.
i. Each one will receive $\$ 600$ in SG60 Vouchers.

Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above will receive \$200 more - or \$800 in vouchers.

ii. The SG60 Vouchers are like CDC Vouchers. They can be used at all businesses that accept CDC Vouchers - and half can be spent at participating supermarkets and the other half at participating heartland merchants and hawkers.
iii. We will disburse the SG60 Vouchers across the month of July. Seniors will claim first, and the rest later.
iv. 

21. That's why we have been providing additional support measures over the last two years to cushion the impact on Singaporeans.
a. Last year, I enhanced the Assurance Package by $\$ 1.9$ billion.
b. The Package has helped to fully offset the effects of inflation for lower-income households, and to provide a significant cushion for middle-income households.

22. We will continue to provide support for as long as needed, within our means. While inflation is expected to ease further this year, prices remain high. Singaporeans are still adjusting to these new price realities. Some have had to tighten their belts, rethink spending habits, or make difficult trade-offs to manage their expenses.
23. Therefore, in this Budget, I will provide additional support for Singaporeans.
a. First, I will provide $\$ 800$ in CDC Vouchers to every Singaporean household.
i. The first $\$ 500$ will be disbursed in May this year. And the remaining $\$ 300$ will be disbursed in January next year.
ii. As with previous CDC Vouchers, half can be used at participating supermarkets. And the other half can be used at participating heartland merchants and hawkers.

While our revenues have increased, we have also spent more on Singaporeans. For example, we provided $\$ 3$ billion in MediSave top-ups in December last year, which will help to cushion the increase in MediShield Life premiums to fund better coverage and higher payouts.
172. We also earmarked resources for projects to boost economic competitiveness, including developing critical infrastructure like Changi Terminal 5, and for the energy transition.
173. Overall, I expect to end FY2024 with a surplus of $\$ 6.4$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.
174. For FY2025, I expect a similar fiscal position, with a surplus of $\$ 6.8$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.

# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?

What are the structural programmes mentioned that aim to equip and empower Singaporeans?,"Education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training.","Sir, we are taking concrete steps to strengthen our social support system. In this Budget, l've focused on families, seniors and their long-term care needs, and persons with disabilities. But we will continue to review and update other policy areas over time. This is the Government's key priority. Because we want to build a Singapore where we have each other's backs, where no one is left behind, and where we continue to stay strong and united as one people.

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

# Strengthening Our National Identity and Our Community Bonds 

148. Our unity is a precious asset, which we must never take for granted. The experiences of countries around the world show how easy it is for trust to be eroded, and for societies to become deeply divided and polarised.
149. We must therefore remain steadfast in nurturing our cohesion and unity. And in this Budget, we will invest more in strengthening our cultural core and our community bonds.
150. We will introduce an SG Culture Pass, to encourage Singaporeans to attend arts and heritage activities.
a. All Singaporeans aged 18 and above this year will receive $\$ 100$ worth of credits, which they can use for eligible activities, like arts and cultural performances, museum exhibitions, and heritage experiences.
b. The credits will be made available from September this year, and are valid until the end of 2028.

c. The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth will share more about upcoming initiatives for the arts and heritage sector.
151. Our hawker centres and markets are an integral part of our way of life. This year marks over half a century since we built our first hawker centres and markets, and the fifth anniversary of the inscription of our Hawker Culture onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
a. To appreciate our hawkers and market stallholders, we will give each stall in centres managed by Government and Government-appointed operators a one-time rental support of $\$ 600$ this year.
b. We will also allocate up to $\$ 1$ billion over the next 20 to 30 years to upgrade ageing hawker centres and to build new centres. This will serve the changing needs of our stallholders and patrons. The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment will provide more details at the COS.

152. Sports is another avenue for Singaporeans of all races, religions and backgrounds to come together. Last year, we cheered on Team Singapore at the Olympics and Paralympics, rejoicing as our flag was raised high. We celebrate with them when they do well, and we encourage them when they face setbacks.
153. We are building new facilities in our heartlands, so that Singaporeans can enjoy sports closer to where they live. In the coming years, we will have new sports facilities in Toa Payoh, Punggol, and Clementi. And we are also upgrading existing facilities in Pasir Ris, Queenstown, and Hougang.
154. We will provide $\$ 100$ in SG60 ActiveSG credits for all ActiveSG members to enjoy sports together with their family and friends. You can sign up for the free membership at the ActiveSG website, and use these credits to book ActiveSG facilities and programmes.
155. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.
c. In this Budget, we are making further moves, including to nurture more promising Singaporean corporate leaders, and we will do more. Several members also spoke about this, including Ms Cheryl Chan, about a talent development strategy. We want to develop Singaporean talent and we want to see more Singaporeans take on leadership positions in the corporate sector.
d. We are also supporting in this Budget, senior worker employment. That's something close to the heart of many Labour MPs. And many of you spoke about this passionately, such as SMS Heng Chee How, Mr Patrick Tay, and Mr Mohd Fahmi. We are convening the Tripartite Workgroup to dive deeper. There will be many issues to work through and I look forward to making progress on all of them with our Tripartite Partners.
23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.
b. So there are no ready models for us to look to.
c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

49. We keep an open mind and study all suggestions carefully.
a. And beyond ideas shared in this house, we continue to engage widely to hear views from all Singaporeans.
b. We do so through participatory platforms, something that Ms He Ting Ru spoke about, like citizen panels, youth panels, and alliances for action. These platforms are resource-intensive. They take a lot of time, but we find them useful, and we will plan to do more.
c. We may not be able to do implement every idea; there will be difference of views. And if we can't implement for whatever reason, we will explain why.
50. Our commitment, the Government's commitment, is that we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that every Singaporean feels supported at every life stage.
a. And the numbers, what we spend on, reflects this commitment. In fact, we spend more on social development than on the economy and security. Actually, social spending is already greater than what we spend on both the economy and security combined. So we are not saying we will do. We have done so in concrete terms.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
b. And we expect social spending to continue to grow in the coming years.
c. It's partly driven by our ageing population and rising healthcare costs.
d. It's also because of our efforts under Forward Singapore to strengthen our social compact. We have fleshed out many programmes in this Budget and the previous one. But as I said there will be more to come, as this is a multi-year effort.


To be clear, this is not about Government spending. We are prepared to spend more where necessary.
a. But it's equally, if not more, important to get the policies right.
b. And to ensure the overall system is fiscally sound and sustainable.
43. And on that basis, we have been taking steps to progressively strengthen the key pillars of our social support and our social compact.
a. We started in Singapore with the basics: universal access to primary school for education; CPF for retirement; government subsidies and the 3Ms for healthcare; and HDB for housing.
b. And we've progressively enhanced these pillars - Workfare for lowerwage workers; Silver Support for the more vulnerable seniors; and SkillsFuture to support all our workers.
44. 

But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.
22. That's exactly why we are taking decisive steps to strengthen SkillsFuture.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

b. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit.
c. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience - managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.
d. Currently, government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, MAS and IMDA have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes, and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders.
e. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at COS.

!

We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.


But despite the uncertainties, we can look ahead with a degree of confidence. Singapore today is far stronger than we were 60 years ago.
a. We have developed a strong and well-diversified economy, supported by a highly skilled workforce.
b. We have built up a robust SAF and a strong diplomatic network, to uphold our sovereignty and security.
c. We have forged a common Singaporean identity, grounded in our shared values and experiences, and our commitment to one another and our nation.
14. This is the legacy of generations of Singaporeans, with each one running a good race. The baton has now been passed, and it is our turn to take Singapore forward. This Budget builds on previous Budgets, not only to address today's challenges, but to plan ahead and secure Singapore's future.
15. Budget 2025 is a Budget for all Singaporeans.

16. It's also a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans. It further advances our Forward Singapore agenda, which incorporates your aspirations and views, and seeks to keep our society strong and united.
17. In this Budget, we will work with you to:
a. Tackle cost pressures;
b. Advance our growth frontier;
c. Equip workers throughout life;
d. Build a sustainable city;
e. Nurture a caring and inclusive society; and
f. Rally as one united people.
18. "
How does the government plan to ensure Singaporeans can seize better opportunities in a rapidly changing world?,"The government plans to navigate uncertainties with gumption and strength, address immediate challenges decisively, and secure their long-term future with confidence.","90. In addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.
a. More and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here.

5. First, how do we navigate a very uncertain global environment, so we can continue to create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans? Quite a number of MPs spoke about this, including Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Edward Chia, and Ms Mariam Jaafar just now.

But we are not resting on our laurels. The Government will do more to better support Singaporeans, young and old, to better equip everyone for the changes in our economy.

a. It has been 10 years since we started. 

## A. Introduction

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


And members may have read in the media today some actions we have taken.
d. We make these proactive moves because we want to ensure Singapore remains a reliable and trusted partner in global trade and commerce. In today's fragmented world, we must work even harder to stay open as a hub, where businesses from all over the world can operate with assurance and confidence.

This is what economic dynamism and growth can deliver for our people. And so we will keep our economy strong and vibrant, and ensure that there are even more opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans - both now and in the future.

# E. Conclusion

79. Mr Speaker, to conclude, the world is going through unprecedented changes. We are contending with tectonic shifts on multiple fronts - geopolitics and trade, technology and energy, demographics and culture.
80. Thriving amidst adversity is never easy but that's what the Singapore story is all about, from the very beginning. And we have strong foundations today that give us the confidence to move forward:
a. We have a strong fiscal footing, built up over years of careful stewardship by our forefathers.
b. We have a clear plan for the road ahead, anchored on our Forward Singapore agenda.
c. We are grounded in our shared values of solidarity and unity.
81. This year's Budget paves the way for us to chart Singapore's next lap - to navigate uncertainties with gumption and strength, to address immediate challenges decisively, and to secure our long-term future with confidence. It is a Budget put together by Singaporeans, with Singaporeans, for all Singaporeans.
82. So let us write the next chapter of our Singapore story and move onward together for a better tomorrow.
83. 

As some of you have highlighted.
b. We've made several significant changes, as SMS Desmond Tan highlighted too.
i. We introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme for mid-career workers.
ii. And the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme to support those who are involuntarily unemployed and need help to get back to work.

23. And so while we have made progress on SkillsFuture, we know that there's still much more to be done. Because you can compare our adult education and training system with our investments in the formal schooling years there's still so much to do to fully build up our SkillsFuture system. This is not just in Singapore. You look around the world in countries everywhere, generally, governments have invested more in pre-employment training than in adult education and training.
a. But compared to other countries, in fact, Singapore is already at the

forefront in many respects.

c. We have to experiment, innovate, and find our own way forward.
d. But we are fully committed to this endeavour; and I expect to put in additional resources in the coming years to further strengthen SkillsFuture.
e. Sir, we cannot save every job, but we will support every worker in Singapore. We will create even more opportunities and better jobs for all Singaporeans.

Now the baton has been passed to us. It is our turn to take Singapore forward.

The world is in flux, and uncertainties abound. To tackle the challenges ahead, we must stay united and work together as one.

Forward Singapore provides a roadmap for our next phase. It involves major resets in our policies and our mindsets to strengthen our social compact.

Budget 2025 will advance this agenda. It is a Budget for all Singaporeans. It is a Budget shaped together with all of you.

We will tackle cost pressures, and provide stronger support for families, seniors, and vulnerable groups.

We will advance our growth frontier by fostering innovation, expanding access to clean energy, and ensuring our workers have the skills to realise their full potential.

We will build a sustainable city, and secure a better and greener future for all.

We will nurture a caring society and an inclusive home - one where every Singaporean feels valued and supported.

Let us rally as one united people and move onward together for a better tomorrow.

70. You don't even have to go far afield to Western countries. Look nearer to home at what's happening in Hong Kong, which several Members also talked about. It used to have a healthy fiscal position. But look how quickly the situation can turn and how they have to take such drastic steps to consolidate their position. So really, we should appreciate all that we have here in Singapore.
a. In contrast to many other countries which are using their revenues to service interest payments, we have the opposite. We receive a boost to our revenues from our investment returns.
b. Just think about it. Countries that have this luxury of investment returns are the ones endowed with oil and gas, or some other natural resources. They have been blessed by the heavens with these endowments. We have nothing, and yet we are in this position. It is truly unique and it is a Singapore miracle.
c. Our fiscal strength is a vital source of competitive advantage in these turbulent times.
d. It's going to get worse. The ride ahead will be bumpier. There are dark clouds over the horizon. No one can predict what the next few years will bring.
i. But the risks have risen sharply.
ii. We have already seen wars in Europe and the Middle East. We may yet see conflict in Asia.
iii. We have to be prepared for a whole spectrum of possible global disruptions and threats. And in today's environment, sadly, global responses to these threats may not be as well-coordinated and effective as before.

e. But in Singapore, we know that if such shocks were to arise, we have the ability to respond swiftly to them (like we did during COVID). Our reserves and our fiscal strength will enable us to protect Singaporeans when it matters, and to turn adversity into opportunity, to turn our vulnerabilities into strengths.

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

144. 

b. But we have to understand the underlying reasons, and avoid pinning the blame on foreigners.
c. Because we can see this happening in so many other countries, where the public discourse ends up spiralling into very negative, very toxic, and xenophobic directions.
d. This is not what we stand for in Singapore. And we must never allow that to happen here.
19. Our approach towards foreign workers is clear - we welcome them to work here, but we do this in a controlled manner, and ensure they complement Singaporeans.
a. And we have continued to fine-tune over time our system of controls.
b. For example, we introduced the COMPASS framework for Employment Passes.
c. We've introduced new measures, like the Workplace Fairness Act, to protect Singaporeans against workplace discrimination.
20. And this approach has contributed to positive outcomes, including low overall unemployment rates, good employment outcomes and rising real incomes of Singaporeans.

B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality?
C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life?


30. As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.
a. That remains the key thrust of our approach.
b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.
c. Singaporean households - across different income levels - have experienced sustained real income growth over the past decade. And

what we have achieved has outperformed many other advanced economies, as you can see from this chart.

Data for Singapore are based on household income per member, while data for Finland and the United Kingdom are based on income equivalised using the modified-OECD scale. Data for the United States and Japan refer to total household income.
31. 

We achieve this by living within our means, and running a balanced budget over each term of government. This means spending prudently to meet our immediate and future needs, ensuring that our revenues cover expenditures, and keeping the tax burden as low as we can, while not burdening Singaporeans with debt.

We understand these concerns. And that's why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures through the CDC Vouchers, and other measures. And for the one-off SG60 surplus sharing package, we decided that a key plank would also be in the form of vouchers, so that it can provide some relief on the cost front.
28. And as I said in my Budget statement, we will continue to provide cost-offliving support for as long as needed, and within our means.

29. The Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party appear to be unhappy and displeased that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with the cost-of-living.
a. They suggest that the Government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost-of-living.
b. But we've never said that.
c. These are temporary help measures; they are not long-term solutions.
d. In fact, they only make up a small part of our overall Budget - the cost-of-living measures and SG60 Package account for about 5\% of our Budget.
e. A much larger part of our spending is in structural programmes especially to equip and empower Singaporeans; through education, skills training, skills upgrading, job training, and the significant moves we are making on SkillsFuture which I highlighted just now. All this will ensure Singaporeans do not just receive help, but are able to stand on their own feet and seize better opportunities for themselves and thrive in a rapidly changing world.


# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?


Let me address these three issues in turn.

# Tackling Infrastructure and Resource Constraints 

55. Third, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in worldclass infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints.
56. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods, and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.
a. Development on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.
b. We have achieved islandwide 5G coverage, and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.



# B. Tackling Cost Pressures 

19. Let me start by addressing concerns over rising costs, for both individuals and businesses.
20. Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.


I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.
27. 

## A. Introduction

1. Mr Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.
2. Members have raised many suggestions. I won't be able to respond to all of them today. But I assure you that we have heard every suggestion and we will study them carefully. The detailed issues relating to specific programmes and schemes will be addressed later at the COS debate.

3. The questions raised by Members during this debate revolve around three main issues:
a. First, how are we supporting businesses and workers to navigate our new economic reality?
b. Second, how are we helping Singaporeans to cope with the strains and stressors of life?
c. And third, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans?
4. 

The measures we have taken in recent years, and are taking in this Budget, will help to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
31. But in the longer term, the best way to adjust to higher prices is to grow the economy and increase productivity, so that all Singaporeans can enjoy higher real incomes and better standards of living. And let me turn to our strategies next in these areas."
How has Singapore's real household income growth compared to other advanced economies from 2013 to 2023?,Singapore's real household income growth outperformed many other advanced economies over the past decade.,"30. As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.
a. That remains the key thrust of our approach.
b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.

what we have achieved has outperformed many other advanced economies, as you can see from this chart.

Data for Singapore are based on household income per member, while data for Finland and the United Kingdom are based on income equivalised using the modified-OECD scale. Data for the United States and Japan refer to total household income.
31. 

We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
9. 

This meant higher wages and real incomes for many, many workers.
b. It will be hard to achieve $4 \%$ growth on a sustained basis. But if we can secure an average of $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ growth per annum over the next decade, we will be able to create better jobs and opportunities, and improve standards of living for all Singaporeans.

35. 

While our revenues have increased, we have also spent more on Singaporeans. For example, we provided $\$ 3$ billion in MediSave top-ups in December last year, which will help to cushion the increase in MediShield Life premiums to fund better coverage and higher payouts.
172. We also earmarked resources for projects to boost economic competitiveness, including developing critical infrastructure like Changi Terminal 5, and for the energy transition.
173. Overall, I expect to end FY2024 with a surplus of $\$ 6.4$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.
174. For FY2025, I expect a similar fiscal position, with a surplus of $\$ 6.8$ billion, or $0.9 \%$ of GDP.

# Building a Singapore Made for Families 

- \$500 Child LifeSG Credits for all Singaporean children aged 12 and below
- \$500 Edusave Account or Post-Secondary Education Account top-up for all Singaporean children aged 13 to 20
- Lower monthly full-day childcare fee caps in Governmentsupported preschools to reduce childcare expenses
- New Large Families Scheme
- \$5,000 increase in Child Development Account First Step Grant for each third and subsequent child born from 18 Feb 2025
- \$5,000 Large Family MediSave Grant to mothers' MediSave accounts for each third and subsequent child born from 18 Feb 2025
- \$1,000 Large Family LifeSG Credits annually to families for each third and subsequent child, in the years the child turns 1 to 6
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

## d. Every Singaporean aged 13 to 20 this year will also receive a $\$ 500$ top-up to their Edusave account, or their Post-

Secondary Education Account. They can use this top-up to pay for their approved education-related expenses.

24. More support will be extended to individuals and families who face greater financial stress.
a. We will increase the rates for the ComCare Assistance schemes, to better support lower-income households with basic living expenses. For example, a 1-person household on Long-Term Assistance will receive an additional $\$ 120$ each month, bringing the monthly cash assistance to $\$ 760$. Those supported by Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance will also receive more than before, based on the household's composition, needs, and income.
b. In tandem, we will increase the Singapore Allowance, which is an ex-gratia payment that some of our pensioners receive. It will increase from $\$ 350$ to $\$ 390$ each month, to support those with smaller pensions. And the monthly pension ceiling will also increase to $\$ 1,320$.
c. Through the ComCare Interim Assistance scheme, we will also provide more support for community organisations as well, to help households in need.

25. 

## Building A Fairer and More Resilient Tax System

163. In this term of government, we've made several significant changes to our tax system. These revenue moves give us the resources we need to meet our spending needs, and also make our fiscal system more progressive.
164. The GST rate increase ensures we have the revenues to look after our growing number of seniors, even with rising healthcare costs.

a. Through the Assurance Package, we have cushioned and delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households.
b. Importantly, we have designed our GST system with permanent GST vouchers. This ensures that lower-income households pay a far lower effective GST rate than higherincome households.
165. We also continue to ensure fairness and improve progressivity in our tax system. This means that those who are better off will pay more in taxes to help their fellow citizens.
166. That's why we raised Property Tax rates for all non-owneroccupied residential properties, which are mainly investment properties, as well as for higher-value owner-occupied residential properties.
a. The Property Tax rate changes coincided with a sharp increase in the Annual Values of properties, which arose because of Covid-19-related supply constraints in the property market.

b. We have therefore revised and updated the Annual Value bands of owner-occupier Property Tax rates for residential properties. And that means that more homes now fall within bands with lower tax rates.
c. To further cushion the impact, we provided Property Tax rebates. In November last year, we announced another rebate of up to 20\% for owner-occupied residential properties in 2025, capped at \$1,000.
d. Taken together, all HDB owner-occupiers and over 90\% of private residential property owner-occupiers will see lower Property Taxes this year.
167. 

# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.

b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

# C. Advancing our Growth Frontier 

32. We will take bold and decisive actions to advance our growth frontier.
33. The Singapore economy now operates at a higher level. But we cannot afford to stand still. Global economic competition is intensifying. And many other countries and cities are pressing ahead. If we fail to stay competitive, we will be left behind. We must therefore redouble efforts to grow our economy, and keep it dynamic and vibrant.
34. Growth has a direct impact on the collective wellbeing of Singaporeans.
a. Last year, our economy grew by more than $4 \%$. 

177. There is still considerable uncertainty about how Government revenues will unfold over the coming decades.
a. At this juncture, it is too early to determine if the recent increase in Corporate Income Tax collections is temporary or a lasting trend.
b. There could be some additional Corporate Income Tax revenue from FY2027 onwards, with the implementation of the Domestic Top-up Tax, which will raise the large MNEs' effective tax rate to $15 \%$. But how much revenue we will get from this change depends on whether these MNEs continue to find it attractive to remain in Singapore.

c. Moreover, there is now great uncertainty about the global tax environment. The new US administration has withdrawn from the earlier consensus forged by the OECD and other countries. And it remains to be seen what further moves the US and other major economies will make in this new geopolitical environment.
d. So we will assess our options as global tax developments unfold, and adjust our policies where necessary.
178. Meanwhile, we are certain that expenditure will continue to rise. Government spending has been rising steadily over the years from about $15 \%$ of GDP to about $18 \%$.
a. And based on historical trends, we can expect our spending to go up to 20\% of GDP by around 2030.
b. With growing global uncertainties, and the need to invest more in our workers, and better support our rapidly ageing population, there will be added pressure to raise spending possibly at a pace that exceeds previous increases.

179. So we will continue to monitor fiscal trends closely, and update our medium-term projections. In the meantime, we will spend responsibly and ensure resources are allocated effectively. If and when there are near-term fiscal upsides, we will put the resources to good use, including for our social and economic needs. Ultimately, we will always ensure that all Singaporeans benefit from our nation's progress.

e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.

d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
9. 

Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.
iii. 

D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

This meant higher wages and real incomes for many, many workers.
b. It will be hard to achieve $4 \%$ growth on a sustained basis. But if we can secure an average of $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ growth per annum over the next decade, we will be able to create better jobs and opportunities, and improve standards of living for all Singaporeans.

35. 

But more importantly, let's look at the overall picture. We continue to have a highly progressive tax and transfer system.
a. Members are familiar with the benefits and tax ratios, which we highlight every budget. And it's worth going through them again.
b. The bottom quintile of households receives $\$ 4$ in benefits for every dollar of tax paid. Middle-income households also get more benefits than tax paid as you go through the income thresholds and levels.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
c. In fact, it's only the top quintile of income earners receives less in benefits, or 30 cents, for every dollar of tax paid. So this is what our system has achieved.
d. So these outcomes are a culmination of years of deliberate moves to enhance the progressivity of our overall taxes and transfers system.
75. There is no fiscal system in the world that can deliver perfect precision and equity. But I think we have found an approach in Singapore that works for us. It is not perfect, but we continue to make it better.

a. Here, everyone contributes to taxes. The lower and middle-income will receive more support, while the higher-income and wealthier segments of the population will contribute more. It's a fair and progressive tax and redistribution system, anchored on our values of a fair and just society.
b. And the strength of our fiscal system is internationally recognised. A recent OECD report commended Singapore on our robust fiscal system.
c. This is hard-earned credibility that we have built up over many, many decades. It is not something we should take for granted, because that same credibility can be quickly destroyed in the wrong hands.
76. And at the end of the day, something as fundamental as this, Singaporeans will decide.
77. Will they prefer a government that underestimates our needs, spends more from our hard-earned reserves, and leaves us weaker?
78. Or will they prefer a government that is steadfast, that upholds fiscal responsibility and discipline, and ensures we have enough resources for current and future generations to handle unexpected challenges?
a. Sir, the PAP's approach is clear: we take our duty as stewards of the country seriously. We remain true to our mission, and manage our finances carefully for the benefit of all Singaporeans, now and in the future.
b. We will continue to do our best to convince Singaporeans that ours is the right approach - it has served us well these last 60 years, and it will continue to keep Singapore on the right track in the years ahead.

# Helping Firms Transform 

10. As we navigate these external challenges, we also must continue to press on with productivity improvements in our own economy.
a. Our labour productivity has been growing at around $2 \%$ per annum over the past decade from 2014 to 2024.
b. Most of this is driven by the outward-oriented sectors of our economy.
c. So we can still do better to improve productivity for our domesticoriented sectors.


It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect. The higher collections were a result of Government action by injecting additional COE quota. This helped to bring prices down by 10 to $30 \%$ from the peaks in Oct 2023. But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



Let's dive deeper into the FY2024 projections because there were some questions raised about them.
a. Mr Louis Chua had filed a written PQ in September asking about the Overall Fiscal Position. Our reply referred to the figure reported in the Budget Book, which was also the figure provided in the Budget statement.
b. In fact, MOF only starts to put together the revised fiscal estimates around the December and January period, when we start to get more data to update our estimates.
c. And as I explained in the Budget statement, one key reason for the revenue upside was the unexpected increase in corporate income tax

collections.
d. Another reason, more generally, is that our economy performed better than expected.
e. Remember, in 2024, early 2024, MTI started the year projecting that the economy would grow at 1 to $3 \%$; we ended 2024 with GDP growth of $4.4 \%$ - well exceeding our expectations. But it's not just us. 

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

Even as spending goes up, we will continue to keep within our means, and maintain a balanced budget over the medium term.
a. And that's why I don't see us being able to put back the amount we had drawn from Past Reserves during COVID (something which Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about).
b. But we will continue to be responsible and prudent with our finances.
c. And if we maintain this approach, our reserves should be able to keep pace with our economy, and we can continue to benefit from a steady stream of NIRC in our revenue stream.
69. Compare this with the fiscal situation in so many other advanced economies around the world, especially in the West.
a. They are running record levels of fiscal deficits; and their national debts are growing faster than their economies.
b. So the fiscal space they have to sustain their higher levels of welfare, while continuing to invest in defence and the economy, is shrinking.
c. And at some point, the reckoning will come.

"

As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.

b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.

It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect. The higher collections were a result of Government action by injecting additional COE quota. This helped to bring prices down by 10 to $30 \%$ from the peaks in Oct 2023. But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


But more importantly, let's look at the overall picture. We continue to have a highly progressive tax and transfer system.
a. Members are familiar with the benefits and tax ratios, which we highlight every budget. And it's worth going through them again.
b. The bottom quintile of households receives $\$ 4$ in benefits for every dollar of tax paid. Middle-income households also get more benefits than tax paid as you go through the income thresholds and levels.
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
c. In fact, it's only the top quintile of income earners receives less in benefits, or 30 cents, for every dollar of tax paid. So this is what our system has achieved.
d. So these outcomes are a culmination of years of deliberate moves to enhance the progressivity of our overall taxes and transfers system.
75. There is no fiscal system in the world that can deliver perfect precision and equity. But I think we have found an approach in Singapore that works for us. It is not perfect, but we continue to make it better.

a. Here, everyone contributes to taxes. The lower and middle-income will receive more support, while the higher-income and wealthier segments of the population will contribute more. It's a fair and progressive tax and redistribution system, anchored on our values of a fair and just society.
b. And the strength of our fiscal system is internationally recognised. A recent OECD report commended Singapore on our robust fiscal system.
c. This is hard-earned credibility that we have built up over many, many decades. It is not something we should take for granted, because that same credibility can be quickly destroyed in the wrong hands.
76. And at the end of the day, something as fundamental as this, Singaporeans will decide.
77. Will they prefer a government that underestimates our needs, spends more from our hard-earned reserves, and leaves us weaker?
78. Or will they prefer a government that is steadfast, that upholds fiscal responsibility and discipline, and ensures we have enough resources for current and future generations to handle unexpected challenges?
a. Sir, the PAP's approach is clear: we take our duty as stewards of the country seriously. We remain true to our mission, and manage our finances carefully for the benefit of all Singaporeans, now and in the future.
b. We will continue to do our best to convince Singaporeans that ours is the right approach - it has served us well these last 60 years, and it will continue to keep Singapore on the right track in the years ahead.

And it's not difficult to see why.
c. Twenty years ago, China accounted for about 9\% of global manufacturing output. Now, it accounts for one-third of global manufacturing output. That's more than the next three countries - the US, Japan, and Germany - put together. China alone.
d. So naturally, there is a huge attempt to rebuild manufacturing in America and Europe.
e. And that's why competition for investments will only intensify.
8. That's why we have to be prepared for tougher competition, and do what we can to stay in the game.
a. We are topping up the National Productivity Fund, which will provide us extra firepower to stay competitive and attract investments.
b. We are taking steps to strengthen our infrastructure, enhance our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our innovation and technology engines.
c. And these moves will translate eventually and ultimately to better jobs and better opportunities for all Singaporeans.
9. We also have to brace ourselves for increased scrutiny of high-tech activities done out of Singapore - something which we discussed in Parliament last week, and which several members also highlighted.

a. We are an open hub, and we welcome and harness technology from different countries.
b. But the key countries, the key sources of technology, are now concerned about technology leakage - they want to keep their proprietary technologies controlled tightly within a safe ecosystem.
c. To be clear, we do not enforce the unilateral export controls imposed by any single country. But we will make efforts to address these concerns, we will lean forward and provide assistance where appropriate, in accordance with our laws. 

## Budget Debate Round Up Speech

Members also had suggestions covering different areas.
a. Mr Dennis Tan, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Xie Yao Quan had suggestions on means testing. This is something we grapple with all the time, because there is no perfect means testing criteria.
i. Even on incomes, you can decide per capita household income, family income (but we don't have data), lifelong earnings income and a whole range of criteria to use.
ii. And we know that increasingly it's not just about incomes as a means test, but also wealth. And several MPs spoke about wealth inequality. Then you have to look at wealth measures. And how do you look at that? What measures do you use? And that's why we have AV as a proxy.
iii. 

This meant higher wages and real incomes for many, many workers.
b. It will be hard to achieve $4 \%$ growth on a sustained basis. But if we can secure an average of $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ growth per annum over the next decade, we will be able to create better jobs and opportunities, and improve standards of living for all Singaporeans.

35. 

Even as spending goes up, we will continue to keep within our means, and maintain a balanced budget over the medium term.
a. And that's why I don't see us being able to put back the amount we had drawn from Past Reserves during COVID (something which Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about).
b. But we will continue to be responsible and prudent with our finances.
c. And if we maintain this approach, our reserves should be able to keep pace with our economy, and we can continue to benefit from a steady stream of NIRC in our revenue stream.
69. Compare this with the fiscal situation in so many other advanced economies around the world, especially in the West.
a. They are running record levels of fiscal deficits; and their national debts are growing faster than their economies.
b. So the fiscal space they have to sustain their higher levels of welfare, while continuing to invest in defence and the economy, is shrinking.
c. And at some point, the reckoning will come.



# A Singapore Government Agency Website How to identify $\cdot$

We have to make assumptions, and we have to decide how we deal with uncertainties.
b. In a crisis, when there is greater volatility in the economy, it is inherently more difficult to predict the turning points.
c. But if you set aside unexpected crises like COVID, our Operating Revenue projections have generally not been far off the mark - the average deviation over the 10-year period from FY2010 to FY2019 was within a reasonable range of $5 \%$.
d. On the latest two FYs, 2023 and 2024, the deviation has been larger, but still around $7 \%$, which comparable still to other jurisdictions like the UK and the Netherlands.
66. "
What adjustments are made to account for household size differences in income growth data?,"For Finland and Japan, household income growth rates are computed using the average household incomes of the 2nd, 5th, and 8th deciles. In contrast, for other economies, including Singapore, the rates are calculated based on household incomes at the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentiles.","30. As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable and the more sustainable way to tackle cost-of-living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains.
a. That remains the key thrust of our approach.
b. And objectively speaking, we have done relatively well.
c. Singaporean households - across different income levels - have experienced sustained real income growth over the past decade. And

what we have achieved has outperformed many other advanced economies, as you can see from this chart.

1. Income growth rates for Finland and Japan are computed using the average household incomes of the 2nd, 5th and 8th deciles, while income growth rates for other economies are computed based on household incomes at the 20th, 50th and 80th percentiles. Data for Singapore are for resident employed households.
2. Where possible, household income growth have been adjusted to account for household size differences across income groups. Data for Singapore are based on household income per member, while data for Finland and the United Kingdom are based on income equivalised using the modified-OECD scale. Data for the United States and Japan refer to total household income.

We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
9. 

133. Many seniors prefer to age in place as much as possible, supported by their families and friends. They can opt for a range of care options. Some may use care services like day care or home care, while others rely primarily on family caregiving. We will also enhance support across the entire spectrum.
a. We will increase existing subsidies for long-term care services in the home and community by up to 10 percentage points, and similarly raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income to $\$ 4,800$.
b. And we will similarly introduce additional subsidies for cohorts born in 1969 and earlier by 15 percentage points.

c. We will also increase the subsidies provided under the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund to cover the rising costs of home healthcare items, like adult diapers, and to also cover additional categories of such items.
134. To better support those who are looking after seniors at home, we will enhance the Home Caregiving Grant. This is a cash grant which can be used to offset daily care costs.
a. We will raise the quantum for the Home Caregiving Grant. The maximum grant will increase to $\$ 600$ per month, from $\$ 400$ today.
b. We will also raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for the Home Caregiving Grant to $\$ 4,800$, so that more caregivers receive support.
135. We expect at least 80,000 seniors to benefit from the enhanced long-term care subsidies and grants, which will be implemented from next year. The enhancements are expected to cost around $\$ 300$ million in FY2026, and more in future years, as our population continues to age.

136. Besides higher subsidies, insurance will also play a part in easing the cost burden of long-term care. With a rapidly ageing population, we have to work hard to manage the increase in longterm care costs, and ensure a good mix of funding support between individual co-payment, government subsidies and insurance. We are studying this issue carefully, and the Minister for Health will say more at COS.

We will increase our support for seniors with more severe care needs and who may require residential care, such as in a nursing home.

a. We will increase existing subsidies for residential long-term care services by up to 15 percentage points. We will also raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income to $\$ 4,800$.
b. Many in the older cohorts, especially those born in 1969 or earlier, do not benefit from CareShield Life, and therefore will face higher out-of-pocket costs. For this group, we will introduce additional subsidies of five percentage points.


We have to make assumptions, and we have to decide how we deal with uncertainties.
b. In a crisis, when there is greater volatility in the economy, it is inherently more difficult to predict the turning points.
c. But if you set aside unexpected crises like COVID, our Operating Revenue projections have generally not been far off the mark - the average deviation over the 10-year period from FY2010 to FY2019 was within a reasonable range of $5 \%$.
d. On the latest two FYs, 2023 and 2024, the deviation has been larger, but still around $7 \%$, which comparable still to other jurisdictions like the UK and the Netherlands.
66. 

## d. Every Singaporean aged 13 to 20 this year will also receive a $\$ 500$ top-up to their Edusave account, or their Post-

Secondary Education Account. They can use this top-up to pay for their approved education-related expenses.

24. More support will be extended to individuals and families who face greater financial stress.
a. We will increase the rates for the ComCare Assistance schemes, to better support lower-income households with basic living expenses. For example, a 1-person household on Long-Term Assistance will receive an additional $\$ 120$ each month, bringing the monthly cash assistance to $\$ 760$. Those supported by Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance will also receive more than before, based on the household's composition, needs, and income.
b. In tandem, we will increase the Singapore Allowance, which is an ex-gratia payment that some of our pensioners receive. It will increase from $\$ 350$ to $\$ 390$ each month, to support those with smaller pensions. And the monthly pension ceiling will also increase to $\$ 1,320$.
c. Through the ComCare Interim Assistance scheme, we will also provide more support for community organisations as well, to help households in need.

25. 

This meant higher wages and real incomes for many, many workers.
b. It will be hard to achieve $4 \%$ growth on a sustained basis. But if we can secure an average of $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ growth per annum over the next decade, we will be able to create better jobs and opportunities, and improve standards of living for all Singaporeans.

# Building a Singapore Made for Families 

121. While we provide targeted help for the more vulnerable groups, we will also do more to support all families across every stage of life. This begins with marriage and parenthood.
a. We have made significant moves in recent years, including enhancing the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and the Government's contributions to the Child Development Account (or CDA).
b. We have just enhanced paid parental leave to 30 weeks in total, which will enable parents to spend more time with their infants.
122. In this Budget, we will further reduce monthly full-day childcare fee caps in Government-supported preschools.
a. The fees will be capped at $\$ 610$ for Anchor Operator centres and $\$ 650$ for Partner Operator centres.
b. After basic childcare subsidies, a dual-income family will pay about $\$ 300$ per child. Lower- and middle-income families will pay less after additional subsidies.

c. So this reduction will keep full-day preschool expenses similar to those of the fees for primary school and afterschool student care combined.
123. Couples with more children often worry about additional costs, because the demands grow with each additional child. We will introduce a Large Families Scheme to support married couples who have, or aspire to have, three or more children. This will consist of three components.
a. First, a $\$ 5,000$ increase in the Child Development Account First Step Grant. This will apply to each third and subsequent child born from today onwards. The CDA monies can be used to defray preschool and healthcare expenses of the child and their siblings.
b. Second, a new $\$ 5,000$ Large Family MediSave Grant. This will be disbursed into the mother's MediSave account again for each third and subsequent child born from today onwards. And this can be used to offset the mother's pregnancy and delivery costs, or her family members' healthcare expenses.

c. Third, $\$ 1,000$ in LifeSG credits will be disbursed annually to families for each of their third and subsequent children, during the years that the child turns one to six. And this can help to defray a wide range of household expenses.


# B. How Should We Navigate Our New Economic Reality? 



We will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC's e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints islandwide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes, and prepare them for interviews.
94. Besides nationwide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.
a. Today, North East CDC runs Job Placement Centres for its district, in partnership with WSG. The centres have yielded meaningful outcomes.

b. We will expand localised job matching to all CDCs across the island.
95. We will also strengthen our support for two groups of workers in this Budget - seniors and ex-offenders.
96. More seniors are staying employed as our population ages. We want to work with employers to tap on the experience and wisdom of seniors who are able and wish to continue working.
a. In the immediate term, I will extend the Senior Employment

Credit (or SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $\$ 4,000$ a month.
b. In line with the increase in the re-employment age, I will raise the qualifying age for the highest SEC wage support tier to 69 years old, from 68 years old today. The Government will reimburse companies up to $7 \%$ of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.

97. Later this year, MOM will convene a Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment. The workgroup will undertake a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies, to improve the employability of seniors, and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.
98. In line with the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, we will proceed with the next step of planned CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers. We will increase the CPF contribution rates for those aged above 55 to 65 by 1.5 percentage points in 2026.
a. We will also continue to provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2026.
b. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost.

What are the basic needs that the social support system in Singapore aims to address?,"The social support system in Singapore aims to provide assurance to citizens across every life stage on their basic needs such as education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.","Sir, we are taking concrete steps to strengthen our social support system. In this Budget, l've focused on families, seniors and their long-term care needs, and persons with disabilities. But we will continue to review and update other policy areas over time. This is the Government's key priority. Because we want to build a Singapore where we have each other's backs, where no one is left behind, and where we continue to stay strong and united as one people.

I show these statistics not to blow our own trumpet; but so we know what the facts are and how we compare with others.
a. But I fully recognise that even with a strong and growing economy, the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.
b. Life in a compact city like Singapore, with no hinterland, can be competitive and it can be stressful, something which members on both sides of the House were quick to bring up in their speeches over the past two days).
32. And that's exactly why, as part of Forward Singapore, we have been taking steps to strengthen our social support system.
a. We want to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage on their basic needs. Basic needs like education, retirement, healthcare, and housing.
b. We want to provide more support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.

c. We want to ensure that no one is left to fend for themselves in Singapore. And if anyone faces setbacks, we have a system in place to help them recover and bounce back stronger.

51. Ultimately a strong social support system should not be reliant on Government alone. Even though the Government is going to do more, it cannot be reliant on the Government alone.
a. We will do more. But our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.
b. And we are very fortunate to have charities and social service agencies doing excellent work on the ground. We appreciate and thank all of them. In this Budget, we are supporting them further with more matching grants for their fund-raising efforts, something which Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Keith Chua welcomed. And we will continue to work with all of them as partners to uplift our fellow Singaporeans.

c. I should also add that many of the issues we are dealing with requires changes, not just in policies, but also in our attitudes and mindsets.
d. The Government will spend more on healthcare, but Singaporeans also have to do their part to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
e. The Government has and will continue to invest in SkillsFuture, but Singaporeans must want to improve their skills, and businesses must give their workers the time and space to go for training.
52. And that's why Forward Singapore is about strengthening our social compact.
a. It's about our shared responsibility - how we support one another, care for those in need, and lift each other up.
b. That's how we build a more inclusive, and a stronger, and more united Singapore.

# Building a Strong and Sustainable Social Support System 

33. These are desired outcomes which I'm sure we can all agree to. The question is how do we achieve them.
34. 

To be clear, this is not about Government spending. We are prepared to spend more where necessary.
a. But it's equally, if not more, important to get the policies right.
b. And to ensure the overall system is fiscally sound and sustainable.
43. And on that basis, we have been taking steps to progressively strengthen the key pillars of our social support and our social compact.
a. We started in Singapore with the basics: universal access to primary school for education; CPF for retirement; government subsidies and the 3Ms for healthcare; and HDB for housing.
b. And we've progressively enhanced these pillars - Workfare for lowerwage workers; Silver Support for the more vulnerable seniors; and SkillsFuture to support all our workers.

We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students, and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.
a. Take 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from St. Andrew's Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills.
b. She was able to secure a 9-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors.
c. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there.

140. We want to see more stories like her. And so we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multiyear endeavour, and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.
141. Concurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities.
142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

142. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities.
a. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.

b. As with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services, and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies.
c. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early.
143. We will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (or SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child's future care needs.
a. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on.
b. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $\$ 10,000$.

# F. Nurturing a Caring and Inclusive Society 

115. A major part of our Forward Singapore agenda is to nurture a more caring and inclusive society - one where every Singaporean feels valued and supported, regardless of age, ability, and circumstance. 

158. Our Self-Help Groups play an important role in addressing the needs of their respective communities, and in strengthening our social compact.
a. I thank the Chinese Development Assistance Council, Yayasan MENDAKI, the Singapore Indian Development Association, and the Eurasian Association for their many contributions.
b. We will provide the Self-Help Groups with additional funding of $\$ 60$ million over the next five years. This will enable them to enhance their programmes and better support their communities.


# C. How Are We Providing Support To Help Singaporeans Cope With The Stresses And Strains Of Life? 

24. This leads to the second issue - how is the Government providing support to help Singaporeans cope with the stressors and strains in life?
25. Mr Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Leong Mun Wai said the GST increase has made it worse by adding to inflation. And Mr Singh said that the GST increase ""turbocharged"" inflation.
a. But let's be clear: as a small and open economy, our inflation was driven primarily by global factors - wars, supply chain disruptions, and rising energy costs.
b. As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, even before the GST increase, prices were already going up globally and in Singapore.
c. And here in Singapore, the central bank, MAS, had assessed that the

effect of the GST increase on inflation would be ""transitory"".
d. Indeed, that was the case. In 2022, CPI inflation was 6.1\%. Then the GST went up by $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2023 and another $1 \%$-point on 1 Jan 2024. What happened to CPI inflation? It moderated to $4.8 \%$ in 2023, and came down further to $2.4 \%$ in 2024 . Where is the turbocharging?
"
Why does the context suggest that the effect of the GST increase on inflation was 'transitory'?,"The context suggests that the effect of the GST increase on inflation was 'transitory' because subsequent CPI inflation rates moderated to 4.8% in 2023 and came down further to 2.4% in 2024, indicating that the initial impact of the GST increase on inflation was short-lived.

It is also the forecasts of many. In fact, I would say virtually all, private sector professional economists.
f. So when you have higher growth, it means higher incomes, which drives consumption, and that shows up in higher collections for GST, for example, and COE.
g. Now, Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that the COE collections were driven by Government policy, which kept prices high, but in fact it was the opposite effect. The higher collections were a result of Government action by injecting additional COE quota. This helped to bring prices down by 10 to $30 \%$ from the peaks in Oct 2023. But it also meant more motor vehicle sales, and then with more sales, more quantity purchased, that's why you have more revenues. So it's not a price effect, it's a quantity effect.


D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans?

# B. Tackling Cost Pressures 

19. Let me start by addressing concerns over rising costs, for both individuals and businesses.
20. Global inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and remained high after that due to energy, food, and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted.


e. Look, I know elections are approaching, but this Chamber is not an election rally. Let's not get carried away by hyperbole, and have a debate based on facts.
26. The fact is inflation has eased - both globally and in Singapore.
a. But people are still concerned about cost pressures.
b. It's not unique to us- it's felt across many other advanced economies, where the headline economic indicators are positive, but sentiments are poor. In the US, they even coined a name for it - they call it ""vibecession"".
c. But there's a reason for the negative vibes. It's not just about feelings or sentiments, it's because price levels remain high, even though inflation has eased. And these create real pressures, and it takes time for people to adjust to these new price realities.
27. 

But if we were to rewind the clock, and consider our situation, imagine what our situation was at the beginning of this decade.
a. We were in the thick of battle, fighting COVID.
b. I know it feels like a bad dream and a distant memory to all of us, but those were truly tough times. In 2020 alone, we had five budgets. In 2021 we had three budgets. We sought the President's approval five times to draw from Past Reserves.
c. And this is 2020, 2021. We had no way of knowing when the pandemic would end, how the virus would mutate, how many more new waves of infection we would face, how many more restrictions we have to impose, and how much deeper a fiscal hole we would end up with.
d. But we already knew for sure that spending needs would rise over the horizon. It was coming, year after year. Healthcare spending was rising,

especially with our rapidly ageing population.
e. We looked at different ways to raise revenues including through property and income taxes. But these moves were still not enough to cover the expected increase in expenditure, which was sure to happen.
59. So what should we do to plug the funding gap?
a. That's why we had to consider the GST increase.
b. It was a difficult decision. It was a difficult choice - it's never easy to raise taxes, and certainly not a tax like the GST.
c. But governance is about making responsible choices, not just popular ones. We must ask ourselves: Do we want short-term populism or longterm stability? Do we want to kick the can down the road or take the hard but necessary decisions?
60. So once there were signs that the economy had stabilised, we decided to proceed with the GST increase.
a. But we also rolled out a comprehensive Assurance Package, which effectively delayed the GST increase for the vast majority of Singaporean households.
b. Essentially, once we decided to move, the GST rates were locked in. But with the Assurance Package, we could be more responsive to changing circumstances. And we could push back effectively the impact of the GST increase.
c. And that's exactly what we did. We had multiple rounds of enhancements to the Assurance Package - to tackle cost-of-living concerns, and to ensure that the majority of households will not feel the impact of the additional GST for at least 5 years.

d. At the same time, we have a permanent GST Voucher, which we also enhanced, and this ensures that the GST and GST Voucher scheme, combined together, will support the lower-income groups and will protect them - not just over the next five or 10 years, but on a permanent and ongoing basis.
61. So with that in place, together with the other revenue moves we made, we are in a better position now. And now, the additional GST revenues have started to come in - and it's mostly, the revenues are mostly from those who are better-off, foreigners, as well as tourists. And it will give us the resources we need to improve our healthcare infrastructure, and take better care of our seniors.
62. What would have happened if we chose to avoid the GST increase because it is unpopular? Or if we did not enjoy the unexpected upsides in corporate income tax collections, which only emerged in the last two years?
a. We would have ended FY2024 in a deficit.
b. The projected balance in FY2025 would also have been a deficit.
c. And that would have meant less funding for essential services, less support for our seniors, and fewer resources to invest in our future.
d. Basically, Singapore and Singaporeans would have ended up in a much weaker position.
63. Several Members I know criticised MOF's fiscal marksmanship.
64. Look, when I started work in MOF decades ago, one of my main tasks was to provide fiscal projections. As an economist, that was what I did. I was one of those who would run the models, and churn out the figures. So I know exactly what this work entails and how difficult it is.
a. I will not defend the figures if they are off the mark.

b. But I will speak up for our MOF officers who do this work with dedication and professionalism against any unfair criticisms.
65. Ultimately, a budget is a projection - it is based on the best available information at that point in time.
a. We have to plan ahead. 

# D. Are We Overly Conservative In Our Fiscal Projections And Plans? 

53. Finally: on a third issue, are we overly conservative in our fiscal projections and plans, especially in light of our surplus position?
54. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the treatment of SINGA and how it contributed to the surplus.
a. Under SINGA, we borrow for major and long-term infrastructure projects. The spending for such projects is capitalised, which allows us to spread the expenses across the useful life of the asset.
b. This, as we have explained, is more equitable as the asset will benefit both current and future generations.

c. This accounting treatment has been in place since FY2021.


## Building A Fairer and More Resilient Tax System

163. In this term of government, we've made several significant changes to our tax system. These revenue moves give us the resources we need to meet our spending needs, and also make our fiscal system more progressive.
164. The GST rate increase ensures we have the revenues to look after our growing number of seniors, even with rising healthcare costs.

a. Through the Assurance Package, we have cushioned and delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households.
b. Importantly, we have designed our GST system with permanent GST vouchers. This ensures that lower-income households pay a far lower effective GST rate than higherincome households.
165. We also continue to ensure fairness and improve progressivity in our tax system. This means that those who are better off will pay more in taxes to help their fellow citizens.
166. That's why we raised Property Tax rates for all non-owneroccupied residential properties, which are mainly investment properties, as well as for higher-value owner-occupied residential properties.
a. The Property Tax rate changes coincided with a sharp increase in the Annual Values of properties, which arose because of Covid-19-related supply constraints in the property market.

b. We have therefore revised and updated the Annual Value bands of owner-occupier Property Tax rates for residential properties. And that means that more homes now fall within bands with lower tax rates.
c. To further cushion the impact, we provided Property Tax rebates. In November last year, we announced another rebate of up to 20\% for owner-occupied residential properties in 2025, capped at \$1,000.
d. Taken together, all HDB owner-occupiers and over 90\% of private residential property owner-occupiers will see lower Property Taxes this year.
167. 

Some of you may ask, and this is the right question to ask, is this sustainable?
a. It will not be sustainable if overall property prices keep rising faster than incomes, and the financing gap keeps growing year after year.
b. But this will not happen because we keep a close watch over the property market, and we ensure it does not happen.
c. That's why we have introduced cooling measures where necessary by increasing the ABSD for multiple property and foreigner purchases. And

we have significantly increased BTO supply as well as Government Land Sales to make up for the disruption that occurred during COVID.
d. And these measures have helped and will eventually stabilise the market.


38. More specifically, when you look at the HDB market - in the short term market, resale prices can be up, and they can be down. In localised popular areas, they will generally be higher than the less popular areas. That's why we introduced a new classification system with the Plus and Prime flats.
39. But overall, in the longer term, we are confident that HDB prices will remain affordable. Why? Because only Singaporeans can buy HDB flats. And we can, and we will build enough housing for every Singaporean household.
40. For now, we have focussed on ensuring that the new flats are available for first-timers, especially young married couples and parents with young children.
a. And we are seeing concrete improvements. The application rate for firsttimer families across all flat types has stabilised: in fact it has come down from 3.7 times in 2019 to 2.1 times in 2024. This is the application rate, so application rates are now below pre-COVID levels.
b. And with a sustained and robust supply of new flats, and as the overall market stabilises, we will have scope to consider how to adjust our policies to meet the needs of other groups, including second-timers and singles.
41. 

11. I know many SMEs are concerned about the high costs of doing business. And several members including SMS Desmond Tan, Mr Mark Lee, and Mr Lim

Biow Chuan reflected this concern.
a. But there are economic realities we cannot avoid.
b. Our land cost reflects its scarcity in our small island nation. And as long as Singapore does well and there is strong demand for land, there will be upward pressure on land prices.
c. Our energy costs are affected by global price levels. We import our energy, and we have limited renewable energy options.
d. Our labour cost reflects the wages of Singaporean workers. And we all want wages to rise. But wage increases have to be matched by productivity gains.
e. A/P Jamus Lim highlighted that wage increases in recent years have lagged productivity growth and there is scope for wages to go up further.
f. But we should be looking at the data over a longer time frame. And over the past decade, real wage growth has been commensurate with productivity growth.
g. And we will continue to push for this. To push for higher productivity as well as higher wages. This is why we opted for the Progressive Wage Model, which ensures continued skills upgrading for workers as they move up the wage ladder.
12. 

We have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, and ended last year on a strong footing.
a. Our economy grew by $4.4 \%$.
b. Inflation continued to ease.
c. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation. The median income of resident workers rose by $3.4 \%$ above inflation.
d. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.
